Generative AI, foundation

models and ML

Generative AI is a collection of

algorithms that produce seemingly

new content by interpreting and

manipulating preexisting data.

This type of AI can generate original

images, text, music, speech and

even code.

Foundation models are large AI neural

networks trained on extensive unlabeled

data and ﬁne-tuned for a variety of

functions. These models undergo self-

supervised training to uncover inherent

patterns that can be applied across a broad

spectrum of tasks—and, for reasons we’ll

explore, they’re key to developing more

advanced and complex models tailored

to your speciﬁc business needs.

While not a new concept, the latest AI

approach is based on a neural network

architecture, coined a “transformer.” The

most powerful algorithms are those that

employ foundation models—a new form

of generative AI that combines transformer

architecture with unsupervised learning,

a ML function.

Powered by foundation models,

generative AI enables semantic search,

code generation, email routing, customer

service and improved automation for

businesses everywhere.

Generative AI, foundation models and ML

Using newer AI techniques like foundation

models alongside traditional ML techniques

can position your organization to get the

most from its data.

ML techniques are great for performing

mathematical and statistical equations,

including making predictions and

forecasts, and detecting patterns,

trends and anomalies.

Generative AI can even be used to

generate more data, known as synthetic

data, that can be fed back to traditional

ML models to make them more accurate.

In the following chapters, we’ll look at the

beneﬁts of combining generative AI with

traditional ML.

Advantages of foundation

models and ML

Let ’s look at the reasons

why foundation models have

established a new paradigm

for AI capabilities →

Powered by foundation models trained

on the full breadth of enterprise data,

generative AI has the potential to unlock

trillions in economic value over the next

decade. And it can improve the speed

and efﬁciency of existing ML efforts.

For example, generative AI could help

you quickly build and deploy traditional

ML models for demand forecasting,

to predict and solve various business

problems—such as supply chain

outages or sales patterns—and act on

new opportunities, such as building

personalized recommendation engines.

3 ways foundation

models add value

Get more accurate results tailored

to your business domain

Save time and money on training

The substantial amount of data and

processing power it normally takes to train

an AI model can easily exceed the ROI

potential of typical business applications—

but not foundation models.

Bring traditional AI into production faster

With the right platform, you can use data

science tools and ML techniques to simplify

model production and automate model

retraining to make informed, insightful

business decisions, including:

Earlier neural networks were narrowly tuned

for individual tasks. They required a very

speciﬁc data set with structured, labeled

data to go into a very speciﬁc AI model. Now

multiply that by the number of tasks you’d

like to delegate to AI and the number of data

sets it would take to get there.

They’re trained on massive unlabeled data

sets with unsupervised learning, which cuts

down the time and expense signiﬁcantly. In

fact, foundation models can make AI more

scalable by reducing the cost and effort of

model training by up to 70%.<sub>2</sub>

Model training and development

– Build experiments quickly and enhance

training by optimizing pipelines and

identifying the right combination of data.

– Use predictions to optimize decisions,

create and edit models in Python, open

programming language (OPL) or with

natural language.

Foundation models, however, can be adapted

to accomplish a broad range of tasks and

tailor outputs to your organization’s unique

data and domain knowledge with a speciﬁcity

that was previously impossible.

You can conduct various types of tasks based

on how you prompt. And with a little ﬁne-

tuning, foundation models can handle jobs

that range from translating text to analyzing

medical images—and with better accuracy.

Integrated visual modeling

– Prepare data quickly and develop

models visually.

– Uncover correlations.

– Validate insights for hypotheses.

– Find relationships and connections

within the data.

Common use cases

and tasks

Curious about where to start? Here

are some of the proven use cases

and common tasks where generative

AI, powered by foundational models,

can be combined with traditional

ML to improve performance and the

accuracy of AI outputs—especially

when data and resources are limited.

Content creation

Generative AI can assist in generating

creative content, such as product designs

or marketing materials, while traditional

ML algorithms can analyze customer

engagement and feedback data to

optimize the generated content for

better performance.

Personalization

Traditional ML algorithms can analyze

customer behavior and preferences to

provide personalized recommendations.

Generative AI models can further enhance

personalization by generating bespoke

content, such as product descriptions

or creative marketing materials, tailored

to each customer’s interests.

Common use cases and tasks

Anomaly detection

Data augmentation with synthetic data

Generative AI can be used to create

Traditional ML models can be used to build

anomaly detection systems to identify

unusual patterns or behaviors in data.

Generative AI models can be used to learn

the normal data distribution and generate

synthetic data samples. The generated

samples can then be compared to real data

to identify anomalies and make predictions

more effectively. Potential business

applications could include network fraud

detection or credit card fraud detection.

synthetic tabular data that’s similar to the

real data, which can then be combined

with the existing data set to enhance the

performance of traditional ML models. This

feature is useful when the real data is limited

or imbalanced. Potential applications include

use in medical research, such as detecting

rare medical conditions, or object detection

in autonomous vehicles.

Forecasting

Traditional ML techniques can be used

to analyze historical data and ﬁnd trends

hidden in your data–including forecasting

customer churn, the likelihood of default

loans, sales cycles and volumes, then

generative AI can be utilized to summarize

insights found, generate customer emails

and personalize recommendations

in marketing outbound efforts.

What to look for

in an AI platform

If you’re considering generative

AI, your organization will

need to comply with legal

and regulatory obligations,

which are still in flux. The right

solution can help you do it.

To be most impactful, AI should integrate

into existing workflows and systems,

automating and augmenting key processes.

Selecting the right AI platform is key

to making this integration happen and

capturing the true potential of scaled AI

for business.

To help you make the most from your

data, an enterprise AI platform should

combine the most important aspects of

AI—predictive, classiﬁcation and ML—for

a holistic approach. The ideal solution

is backed with four key elements, which

we’ll explore on the next page.

What to look for in an AI platform

Four key elements of the ideal

enterprise AI platform

1\. Open

3\. Targeted

To realize maximum business value from

AI, it ’s crucial for organizations to provide

their data scientists, developers and

business analysts access to high-quality,

trustworthy data, anywhere–with a uniﬁed

AI and data platform for building and

reﬁning AI models at a pace to drive rapid

business innovation.

When it comes to selecting an AI model,

it ’s best to have a variety of sizes and

architectures so you can pick what’s best

suited to your needs. Your data and AI

platform should provide the ability to

build, train, validate tune and deploy AI

using both curated open-source models

and private foundation models that can

bring in business domain context.

Consumer AI isn’t the same as enterprise

AI. Models should be highly curated to

business domains and use cases that drive

quick gains in productivity and time to

value—such as augmenting and automating

HR, customer service and code generation.

4\. Empowering

Your generative AI and ML platform should

empower you to be an AI value creator,

not just a user. You shouldn’t be limited to

just prompting someone else’s AI model

with no control over the model or the data.

Regardless of if you’re a data scientist or a

business user, the platform should allow you

to build, train, tune and deploy, and govern

the data and AI models you’re using.

2\. Trusted

Before deploying a model, you need

to ensure that it delivers reliable results

and helps keep the data—and your

intellectual property (IP)—secure. AI should

be explainable, fair, robust and transparent.

All models should offer transparency into

the data’s origin, bias and governance.

The solution should track data, curating

methods and models, enabling AI that can

be updated to meet evolving business and

regulatory requirements.

What to look for in an AI platform

Watsonx.ai studio is

helping companies

custom build AI solutions

to suit their speciﬁc needs.

Finally, let ’s acknowledge the concerns

about generative AI adoption. Information

accuracy, security, privacy, ethics and

IP have emerged as key causes for

concern regarding AI. That’s quite a list.

If you’re considering generative AI, then

you’re keenly aware that you’ll need to

demonstrate your organization’s effort

to comply with legal and regulatory

obligations—which are themselves in flux

right now. The right solution can help you

do it. That’s where IBM comes in.
