**EvaluationWarning:ThedocumentwascreatedwithSpire.PresentationforPythonwatsonx** SaaS Subscription 

*How the watsonx SaaS Subscription works*

There are three types of parts

- Subscription parts
- Overage parts for overage usage and fees
- AI and IA sellers are compensated on the subscription
- ESP parts for watsonx SaaS

Subscription Parts

- Think of these as a gift card. Customers commit to a minimum spend towards watsonx\* for a time period
- Customers usage of watsonx services will count against (deduct from) their gift card spend at rates designated by the product
- Committed spend is billed based on quoted frequency (month / quarter / year, etc.)
- Discounting available for spend
- Parts are priced in local currency values

ESP Parts

- Allows clients to pay on a consumption basis with the remainder        commitment if unused, to be paid at the end of the 1-year term.
- Parts are priced in local currency values
- One invoice account is billed at the agreed upon discounted rates during the term of the commitment.

*How to use the watsonx SaaS Subscription*

- Quote the watsonx as a Service Subscription part in your customer’s local currency for their desired amount of spend
- Quote must also include the Overage part in customer’s local currency to cover potential overage fees. SQO will automatically add this to your quote. 
- Monitor your customers usage, and sell ahead of potential overages 

Overage Parts *How can existing SaaS customers use watsonx*

- When customers run out of their Subscription spend, they 

  are charged for overage usage. These parts are required to  • watsonx saas services can be consumed with available IBM cloud cover those situations credits previously purchased by other subscriptions

- Parts are priced in local currency values
- Discounting not available for overage parts [Learn More: How to Price Quote and Order watsonx](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC3BGWfc9VJ988CF273HMXQdfVWG)

[**SaaS Calculator (FMs)**](https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DCj32h288FRTQGWG7qdFpB6jmJGd)

**How to estimate foundation model inference tokens:**

- ***1 token** ~= 4 characters or 3/4 of a word*  
- ***100 tokens** ~= 75 words*
- ***Reference point:** the collected works of Shakespeare ~ 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.*
- ***Total token count** =  (total use case wordcount \* 1.33)*

  **Note:**

  **Embedding models** are only charged per 1000 input tokens, output is not charged. This is the industry norm.


**EvaluationWarning:ThedocumentwascreatedwithSpire.PresentationforPython**What is a Model Billing Class?

A billing class represents a **price point** that we charge for foundation model inference (i.e. it has a chargeable part number).  One model is assigned to only one billing class; a billing class can have multiple models (as illustrated below).  A model may be moved to a different billing class if IBM decides to change the price of inference for that model. To see the current list of models and their billing class assignment, see **this [page**.](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html?context=wx&audience=wdp)**



**Class C1 ($0.0001)![](Aspose.Words.9988c80c-e048-4f38-b1a2-4ebda20206a6.016.png)**

**Class 2 ($0.0018)**

- Model C![](Aspose.Words.9988c80c-e048-4f38-b1a2-4ebda20206a6.018.png)

- Model F![](Aspose.Words.9988c80c-e048-4f38-b1a2-4ebda20206a6.019.png)



**How models are assigned to a billing class:**

- Generally: Higher Class = Bigger model = more expensive to run
- IBM and 3rd party models are assigned to the most appropriately priced billing class to align with our competitive strategy for each model type.
- Billing class names are intentionally “generic” to allow maximum flexibility of what models can be associated with each price point.  Think of the billing classes as generic “buckets” that models can be assigned to.
