   State customer problem set.

   What are we looking to solve – is it economic or technological? 

   **Template Example:** 

   Tractor Supply Account in Americas

**Nature of Problem![ref3]**

- Tractor Supply is experiencing substantial cost overruns as they have worked to migrate their on premise data warehouse solution to Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse.
- Economic – cost unpredictability and insufficient scale options as workload demands change. 
- Tractor Supply is forced to deploy much larger virtual data warehouses than estimated during ETL batch windows. The larger virtual virtual data warehouses are driving exponential costs during this time. 

**Proposed Solution![ref3]**

- Utilizing watsonx.data, Tractor Supply will reassign ETL work to its Spark engine and process ETL batches into a shared Iceberg / Parquet repository 
- Snowflake will consume the Iceberg that is created by watsonx.data without needing to scale out the ETL processing the virtual data warehouse. 
- X% savings due to not scaling the virtual data warehouse.
