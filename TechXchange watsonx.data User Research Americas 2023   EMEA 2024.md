Americas and EMEA companies voiced

This is an overview of TechXchange findings relevant to EMEA &

Americas markets, & how they apply to positioning watsonx.data

in said markets.

governance concerns: EMEA concerns moved

beyond scope of watsonx.data while Americas

center data governance (i.e., security, privacy)

Data indicate it ’s more nuanced…

Americas and EMEA companies are at

different phases of their journey to AI

Per one CSM interlock attendee’s observation,

we are missing bells-and-whistles, including

one crucial ingredient for greater EMEA wins.

High-level observations

Americas’23

EMEA’24

In highly-regulated industries & government,

(data) governance must come first

Data governance concerns bleed into AI

decisions; primary governance focus: models

Some still need to uncover/choose the data to

suit their needs (not even at the bottom rung

of the journey to AI ladder!)

Many seem motivated to implement AI to aid

in data discover y, or could be persuaded

More typically preparing data for ML /AI than

dismantling data silos (likely, changing data

management platforms is a harder sell)

Still wrestling with data security, privacy

Key points

Americas attendees skew low in

ML-readiness, working on data

management, removing silos

Lower sunk- cost in Americas’ data

management solutions, likely more

open to data availability value prop

Takeaways

1

Value prop, “… for all your data, anywhere,” best for

companies lower in ML-readiness: largely those in

the Americas. Consider data quality & metadata

management appeals for EMEA market.

Consider starting with an open-ended discovery

question about customer ’s current challenges to

better gauge their top-of-mind obstacles.

Once Semantic Enrichment - and especially

Semantic Chat - is available, discuss AI-assisted

data discover y, how we help customers

understand what data they actually have.

Many customers are continuing to have problems with hybrid cloud

and accessing data across it, especially early in their journey.

A large, early-journey (Americas)

concern: access to data on hybrid

cloud

•

Seeing “hybrid cloud” prompted comments about even getting to

cloud

•

Others discussed working toward making their data accessible

across an established hybrid cloud

Methodology notes

People didn’t know what “LORA” (one of the

examples of tuning methods) was.

People didn’t understand “data modalities” nor

“modalities of data” (answers related to data

sources, subjects, database paradigms, but not

modalities)

“What makes this difficult?” was asked generally as

opposed to just as a follow-up on how they currently

index, display, and manage modalities of data in a

lakehouse.

Big Ideas / Opportunities

AI-assisted data discovery should speak to

EMEA clients who’ve purchased x.ai and are

using Azure Databricks

Introducing Semantic Layer/Automation would

appeal to EMEA crowd , especially if we beat

Databricks’ Lilac venture (given CSM reports of

Azure incumbency)

Leveraging AI to catch errors and improve

models while upholding data privacy

How might we reduce the time it takes to

address issues and errors without data privacy

risks? We would most benefit from GenAI help

tuning other ML models, using cleaning logic

and escalating issues to analysts so that they

can find bigger errors; currently this takes ~20

mins\* and can result in analysts being exposed

to data they shouldn’t see (potentially crossing

into breaking NDAs). - P6, Americas
