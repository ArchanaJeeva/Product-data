Five truths of generative AI


**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**

Truth 1 ![](Aspose.Words.5a99ac07-3e5a-452f-9a4b-49404a8d49f6.007.png)

Multi-model

Two thirds of 150+ enterprises surveyed report pursuing a multi- model strategy

- 60% + of enterprises pursuing multi-model are experimental with commercial & open- source models
- Commercial & open- source innovation
- Quickly prioritize use cases that will outlive the model
- Multi-modal (text, image, audio, etc.)
- One model will not rule them all

Truth 2

Multi | hybrid cloud![](Aspose.Words.5a99ac07-3e5a-452f-9a4b-49404a8d49f6.008.png)

Gartner reports that most enterprises will deploy generative AI across hybrid / multicloud environments

- Run where the workflows, apps and data live
- Infer where business runs to drive performance, cost, and simplicity
- Data location to drive security benefits
- Regulatory compliance to influence location selection

Truth 3

Governance![](Aspose.Words.5a99ac07-3e5a-452f-9a4b-49404a8d49f6.009.png)

Surveyed companies report governance as a top requirement, impact of generative AI makes governance more difficult

- Businesses must control bias and monitor drift
- Organizations must actively monitor hallucinations and ensure model explainability 
- Leaders must seek practices and tools to ensure model and data provenance

Truth 4

Scale for value![](Aspose.Words.5a99ac07-3e5a-452f-9a4b-49404a8d49f6.010.png)

Critical to pick the right use cases and deployment for generative AI ROI  

- Different work tasks have strongly positive or negative ROI impact
- Time savings for a meaningful product innovation +40%; business problem solving -23% time needed
- 60+ points difference in value for work tasks
- 25x difference in cost per inference,  depending on model and deployment

Truth 5

Data matters![](Aspose.Words.5a99ac07-3e5a-452f-9a4b-49404a8d49f6.011.png)

Generative AI pilots have not made it to production due to challenges with data quality, access, 

and security 

- Short run: model innovation creates value
- Long run: data quality will decide which enterprises win with generative AI
