Security. Governance. Transparency. These are just a small sampling of the issues that organizations will need to confront as they seek to capitalize

on the vast opportunities presented by generative AI (gen AI). In New Zealand, a hotbed for gen AI innovation, Frankly.AI has developed a

platform that amalgamates expert insights from various sources, including AI- mediated interviews, detailed panel transcripts and published papers.

Based on its mission of â€œno voice left behind,â€ Frankly.AI designed its platform to do more than just gather opinions; it scales the discourse

using gen AI, ensuring that a broad spectrum of perspectives are heardâ€”not just those with the most influence. By synthesizing these diverse

inputs, Frankly.AI effectively identifies and focuses on the most pertinent and impactful aspects of expertsâ€™ views. Looking for a faster and

more efficient way to capture the â€œmeatâ€ of these discussions, Frankly.AI turned to watsonx.aiâ„¢, IBMâ€™s next- generation AI and data

platform. To test its effectiveness, the company brought ina team from IBM to co- createâ€”with its own internal staffâ€”a proof-of-concept

(POC) solution. Its target: the transcripts of the New Zealand AI Forum, through which government agencies regularly convene to assess the

impact of AI on all facets of New Zealand society. watsonx.ai The joint team built a model that automatically extracts raw data from forum

discussiontranscripts, along with associated researchpapers. In the background, the solution uses the Smart Document Understanding function

within the IBM WatsonÂ® Discovery service to organize the content by topic, speaker and other relevant parameters. IBM WatsonÂ®

Discovery Where IBMÂ® watsonx.ai plays its core role is in delivering the most accurate, concise and targeted insights to the people using the

consultation chatbot. Based on each userâ€™s unique query into the system, IBM watsonx.ai runs all that aggregated content through one of its

many pre-trained large language models (LLMs). What it generates are pithy, relevant insights they can useâ€”and trust. By all measures, the two-

week project delivered on its stated goal of more efficient and timely summarization. By working with IBM Customer Success and Client

Engineering teams to deliver a practical use case, roughly 100 members of the New Zealand AI Forum used the POC solution to generate a white

paper from its proceedings for consumption by AI entrepreneurs, investor groups, regulators, researchers, educators and the public at large.

Ordinarily, such an â€œauthorship by committeeâ€ endeavor could conceivably take months or more. By capitalizing on the advanced capabilities

of IBM watsonx.ai, Frankly.AI has shown that gen AI can dramatically streamline and simplify the process. Frankly.AI (link resides outside of

ibm. com) is an Auckland, New Zealand-based startup focused on accelerating the adoption of generative AI. A unit of Becaâ€”one of the largest

independent advisory, design and engineering consultancies in the Asia Pacific regionâ€” Frankly.AI is a platform that utilizes generative AI to

facilitate user-led discussions ona broad spectrum of topics.The company uses AI to automatically process conversations to provide insights into
