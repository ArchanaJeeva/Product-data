Scale AI for business with watsonx

The AI landscape has very quickly evolved from the  run  ![](Aspose.Words.de0cb22e-7cb5-4ae3-b36e-13564a5c5b68.003.png)your business and apply AI to help  paradigm to a reality  where many enterprises are racing to embed AI into how  they operate. In fact, a new IBM study found that 75% 

of CEOs surveyed said they believe the organization with the most advanced generative AI wins, while 43% said their enterprises are already using generative AI to inform  ![](Aspose.Words.de0cb22e-7cb5-4ae3-b36e-13564a5c5b68.004.png)strategic decisions.1 

However, there are several emerging concerns with generative AI, such as how to:

`  `Keep pace with the rapid innovation of AI technologies.   ![](Aspose.Words.de0cb22e-7cb5-4ae3-b36e-13564a5c5b68.005.png)  Monitor the accuracy and trustworthiness of models.    

`  `Trust closed proprietary models without knowing how 

they were trained.

`  `Minimize the cost and energy consumption of large- ![](Aspose.Words.de0cb22e-7cb5-4ae3-b36e-13564a5c5b68.006.png)

scale models.

Open

**Based on the latest AI and cloud technologies**  

With watsonx, clients can take advantage of curated technologies of the open-source community for optimizing workloads, accessing and sharing a single copy of data, and building generative AI. The platform is built on open technologies, including Red Hatfi, Apache Iceberg, Presto, Spark and the PyTorch machine learning framework. Users can also choose from a variety of models from IBM and Hugging Face, which are pretrained to support a range of use cases, including customer service and support, HR productivity, and code translation and generation. 

![](Aspose.Words.de0cb22e-7cb5-4ae3-b36e-13564a5c5b68.010.png)

Targeted

**Designed for business use cases that unlock new value** With watsonx, choose from purpose-built AI assistants 

or customize models in the platform. Within the platform, choose from IBM Granite models and some of the most pertinent third-party open models from companies like  Meta and Google to serve your use cases. IBM-developed  AI models are trained on business-relevant data sets, and this training data was filtered for objectionable content.  

You can also bring your proprietary data to IBM base models and build a model that s specific to your use cases. With prompt engineering and tuning techniques you can improve accuracy, accelerate time to value and enhance cost-efficiency.
