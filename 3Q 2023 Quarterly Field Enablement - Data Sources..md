Building **Generative AI** and open-source capabilities into our databases

**IBM Foundation Models and Generative AI**

**Since 2017, IBM Research has developed a suite of foundation models which lay the groundwork for generative AI use cases across the enterprise. IBM’s suite of foundation models are designed to ensure model trust and efficiency in business applications**

**New: Generative AI and open-source capabilities into databases** 

- **The platform for AI and data:** Train, tune and deploy AI across your business with watsonx, leveraging critical, trusted data wherever it resides. Leverage watsonx.data as a store for data accessed or generated as part of pre- trainingwatsonx.aimodels. 
- **Incorporating generative AI to support more users:** Leveraging watsonx.ai foundation models to simplify how both technical and non-technical users work with data, using natural language to discover, augment, and enrich watsonx.data data and metadata in a conversational user experience 
- **Breaking down data silos:** Building central and shared meta-data layer through Hive Metastore allowing customers to view their entire data ecosystem for analytics and AI, starting with watsonx.data, Db2 Warehouse, and Netezza, and share data in open data formats such as Parquet and Iceberg table format.
- **Multiple fit-for-purpose engines:**Allowing multiple engines, such as Presto, Spark, Db2, and Netezza, to work with the same data so customers can use the right engine for the right workload. Creating additional tooling and services to help customers understand their workload characteristics to achieve the optimization.
