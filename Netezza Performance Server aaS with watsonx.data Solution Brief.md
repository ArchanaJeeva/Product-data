In the era of rapidly expanding data volumes, varieties and complexities, organizations face the challenge of managing the costs associated with running their warehouses for mission-critical workloads. At the same time, the sense of urgency has never been higher for businesses to use AI for competitive advantage. When it comes to the next generation of analytic and AI workloads, organizations require a data warehouse that can support unified analytics and AI across deployments, provide cost-predictability and control, and reduce governance and compliance risk.

IBMfi Netezzafi Performance Server is the advanced cloud-native data warehouse that s designed to operationalize high-performance analytics and AI across the hybrid cloud. With support for open formats, the Netezza solution empowers you to run complex queries with minimum data movement. It seamlessly integrates with the IBM watsonx.data  data store, built on an open data lakehouse architecture, so you can optimize analytics and AI workloads across all your data from a single point of entry while reducing your costs. And with AI-infused elastic scaling, IBM Netezza Performance Server offers you efficiency and cost predictability at scale in the cloud. It s now available as a fully managed service on AWS and Azure.

With IBM Netezza Performance Server, achieve your ideal balance of performance to storage with AI-infused elastic scaling. 

`  `Our AI workload analysis model output can be used to predict and schedule 

scaling based upon workload needs. Choose from available Netezza contours and specify your performance requirements in micro-increments to use only what you need, when you need it.

`  `Netezza cloud elastic computing also enables granular elastic pricing you can 

scale up and down while only paying for what you use no t-shirt sizes. IBM Netezza Performance Server as a Service can help clients achieve up to 47% lower licensing costs, as well as up to 78% faster performance compared to major cloud data warehouse competitors.1

`  `Elastic scaling handles both planned and unplanned spikes in data warehouse requests or demand for computing power and helps accommodate these short-term needs while continuing to meet service-level agreements (SLAs) for downstream applications.

`  `Elastic computing also enables elastic pricing you can scale up and down 

while only paying for what you use. IBM Netezza Performance Server is a cloud-based data warehouse that can be brought up and taken down with minimal investment in time and resources.

**Access and manage your data easily with fully managed capabilities**

With IBM Netezza Performance Server as a fully managed service, you have no overhead, no indexing, no tuning and automated maintenance. This zero- management approach means no armies of administrators are required, which helps your teams stay focused on other important tasks besides keeping your data warehouse up and running. It s as easy as deciding how fast you want to go and how much data you need. Upgrading is also made easy and risk-free with single command nz\_migrate or a nz\_backup and nz\_restore, which allows frictionless upgrades on premises, on cloud or as a hybrid solution, providing a seamless on-ramp to cloud. 

IBM Netezza Performance Server is now available as a service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, bringing trusted, price-performant analytics to your data in the cloud with fully managed service capabilities. Organizations can accelerate their data modernization strategy in the cloud by combining the elasticity and governance of IBM Netezza Performance Server for analytics workloads with the scale, agility and cost efficiency of the cloud. The Netezza solution provides you with the ability to move to the public cloud or augment your on-premises IBM Netezza Performance Server for IBM Cloud Pakfi for Data System environment.
#### **Unify your data across hybrid cloud for analytics and AI**
#### The Netezza platform makes data unified, accessible and scalable in the cloud to accelerate decision-making and innovation across your organization. 
`  `It empowers data engineers, data scientists and data analysts to share data 

and run complex queries across any data type with support for open formats, such as Parquet and Apache Iceberg.

`  `It seamlessly integrates with the watsonx.data data store, built on an open 

data lakehouse architecture, enabling you to now run analytics and AI workloads on all your governed data at scale across hybrid cloud from a single point of entry. You can use fit-for-purpose query engines, such as Presto and Apache Spark, that optimize workloads for all data types while reducing data warehouse costs.

`  `Data scientists and analyst teams can also execute custom machine learning 

(ML) code and models that operate on data in place and predict and score directly inside the database. Use governed data from the Netezza solution to build, train, tune and deploy your own ML models. IBM Netezza Performance Server supports all major programming languages, including Python, C, C++, R, Lua and Java.
