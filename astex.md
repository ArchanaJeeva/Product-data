â€œLearn a new language, get a new soul,â€ claims a Czech proverb. While this may be too ethereal for some, learning a new language can unlock opportunities. For many professionals, English language skills can help employees close deals, get promotions or score work abroad. Language-training school ASTEX, based in Madrid, Spain, has seen careers skyrocket after students completed its courses. â€œCorporate students come to us because their companies need them to improve or update their English skills,â€ explains Macarena Uceda MÃ¡rquez, Key Account Manager at ASTEX. â€œMany of our students need to perform their daily jobs in English, interact with clients, adhere to new American management requirements or prepare to expatriate to an English-speaking country.â€ ASTEX students come from various industries and have a wide range of training needs, from seeking intensive immersion to learning sales language around a specific product set. First, students had to complete a written and spoken level test to evaluate their language ability and class level. For the spoken portion, students then booked a phone call with a teacher. On average, the level test was taking students 40â€“60 minutes. Time savings Â  Slashes average time needed for level test by 80% from 50 minutes to 10 minutes Co-creation using AI Â  Co-creates 3 AI-driven MVPs in 4 months Next, students worked one-on-one with teachers to determine which class offerings would be the best fit. This required teachers and students to coordinate a meeting time, and teachers had to remain updated on the extensive course catalog. Many potential students abandoned the program because the level test and course scheduling proved too tedious and time-consuming. When a student chose a learning path, the course content was static, with no option for customization. Data showed that only 10% of alumni were continuing to use the learning platform after completing a course. ASTEX wanted to use AI to streamline studentsâ€™ onboarding experience, offer personalized learning plans and improve the programâ€™s scalability by reducing its dependence on humans. IBM Business Partner Ivory Soluciones connected ASTEX with IBM because of the tech companyâ€™s expertise in AI solutions. Working closely together, ASTEX, Ivory and IBM developed the ASTEX Language Innovation platform on IBM CloudÂ® with IBM WatsonÂ® technology. IBM CloudÂ® IBM WatsonÂ® To hone its vision for an enhanced learning platform, ASTEX collaborated with IBM Garageâ„¢â€”a framework for digital transformationâ€”and participated in an IBM Garage Enterprise Design ThinkingÂ® Workshop. â€œDuring the workshop, we were able to uncover our studentsâ€™ specific pain points, put them on paper and determine what a better student experience truly means,â€ explains MÃ¡rquez. IBM Garageâ„¢ Because the IBM Garage Methodology focuses on user-centered design, agile development and strategic scaling, ASTEX kept the student at the center of every decision and incorporated numerous points of view into workshop discussions. Students, teachers, designers, developers and executives came together to discuss ways to improve the ASTEX Language Innovation platform. The team identified three minimum viable products (MVPs) that would have the greatest impact. First, create a shorter level test that could provide the same accurate results for student placement. Second, build an AI assistant that is available 24 hours a day to help students. Third, offer a digital speaking practice in addition to the existing learning skills of reading, writing and listening. During an architecture workshop, ASTEX decided to build the MVPs on IBM Cloud to help control compute services expenses and speed deployment. Based on a hybrid, microservices-based and Platform as a Service (PaaS) architecture, the solution provides scalability and resilience and allows ASTEX to independently manage and refine features of each MVP without affecting the entire system. With IBM Watson technology as the AI backbone for the three MVPs, data scientists used IBM Watson Studio with Auto AI to create, manage and deploy efficient data models and IBM Watson Machine Learning to run the models. IBM Watson Studio IBM Watson Machine Learning ASTEX, Ivory and IBM delivered the first MVP in only eight weeks and the second and third MVPs over the next two months. ASTEX developers learned a new programming language and adopted lean, agile ways of working. The team used extreme programming techniques to remove technical debt and change solution features. Agile ceremonies such as weekly iterations, retrospectives and iteration planning meetings helped the team gather feedback from stakeholders and update the solutions as needed. As a result of the first MVP, the time needed for a student to take a level test has been slashed from an average of 50 minutes to 10 minutes, an 80% improvement.Â IBM Watson Natural Language UnderstandingÂ can process studentsâ€™ spoken and written test answers by extracting and analyzing phrase properties such as number of verbs and nouns. IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding The second MVP, ASTEX Language Intelligence (Ali), is a digital assistant that accompanies students throughout their ASTEX learning experience. Ali helps onboard students and assists in placing them in the right class because it asks up front what the studentâ€™s job is, why they are studying English and how much time they have to devote to language training. The system can interact in a human-like way, helping students express themselves naturally. Ali also assists with administrative tasks such as canceling a class and finding ways to boost a grade. It provides students with feedback on their progress and can suggest areas of improvement. Ali usesÂ IBM Watson DiscoveryÂ to recommend exercises that fit with a studentâ€™s interests and learning path. For example, if a student has expressed an interest in traveling, Ali will customize that studentâ€™s coursework with exercises involving travel so that the content is more engaging. Ali is available to students 24 hours a day, seven days a week. IBM Watson Discovery The third MVP, the digital speaking practice, usesÂ IBM watsonx Assistant,Â IBM Watson Speech to

TextÂ andÂ IBM Watson Text to SpeechÂ solutions to help teachers create written or spoken dialogs that vary in complexity based on a studentâ€™s needs. This digital tutor and oral language practice are available to students around the clock through a virtual tool or over the telephone. IBM watsonx Assistant IBM Watson Speech to Text IBM Watson Text to Speech Because ASTEX team members had such a positive experience with user-centered design, they decided to apply this approach to the ASTEX Language Innovation platform interface as well. Teachers and students gave input on the applicationâ€™s design and organization, while IBM and ASTEX confidently made changes knowing that they wouldnâ€™t break any other parts of the containerized architecture. The updated design is clearer and more intuitive for users, enabling them to access information and find resources more easily. User feedback on the improved ASTEX Language Innovation platform has been unanimously positive. Although the core program is the same, the updates seamlessly integrate with the existing system and elevate the entire experience. The platform is more dynamic, with a customized plan for each student. This optimization increases user engagement and improves outcomes. The learning platformâ€™s AI-driven components are revolutionary. â€œNo one else in the language-training industry offers digital speaking practice like this,â€ explains MÃ¡rquez. â€œThe assistant Ali is also a differentiator because people have become used to chatbots, but it is a shocking difference to actually be able to have this kind of interaction with a machine.â€ Because of her machine-learning capabilities, Ali will continue to become even more intelligent with every input. Further, since technology automates simple tasks, teachers can focus on more complicated tasksâ€”and teaching. ASTEX is now able to easily scale its platform, which Ivory and IBM plan to help evolve. â€œAt ASTEX we have always been clear that being at the forefront of technology and pedagogical innovation is key to maintaining ourselves as a benchmark in the sector, and that is why we rely on the best and invest heavily in constant evolution,â€ explains Alfonso de la Torre, Director of ASTEX. â€œIn this case, who better than IBM to accompany us to apply Artificial Intelligence to language training?â€ Ready to see what IBM Garage can do for your business?
