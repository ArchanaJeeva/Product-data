|Summary|<p>Eliminate data silos by sharing Db2 and Netezza tables with watsonx.data through open table </p><p>and data formats, such as Apache Iceberg, Parquet, Avro and ORC, and CSV, JSON, and more. </p>|Optimize costly warehouse workloads with fit- for-purpose engines (Presto, Spark) that scale automatically. Cloud object storage also gives Netezza customers the ability to cheaply store their data. |Watsonx.data customers can promote their curated data into Db2 Warehouse and Netezza.  |
|Customer Example|A global retailer wants to build a new AI model to help it predict customer churn. To do that, they'll need the detailed customer information stored in their Db2 and Netezza data warehouses and marry that data with recent transactions in Oracle and Db2 without duplicating or creating additional ETL. They can now share data for AI/ML workloads from their Db2 Warehouse or Netezza instance with their watsonx.data instance using the first-party integration capabilities in the product. This allows customers to get a singular view of their analytics estate.|<p>A large US bank has multiple copies of historical data in Db2 Warehouse (or Netezza) just in case they need it for specific look back reporting or predictive analytics scenarios. Those workloads don't belong in a high-performance warehouse, and they're perfect to cost optimize with watsonx.data. At the same time, they can </p><p>ensure that those workloads in watsonx.data have no impact to the performance of existing mission critical business intelligence and reporting workloads in Db2 warehouse or Netezza. </p>|<p>A media organization is looking to leverage data from different sources across on-premises and clouds (Oracle, Db2, PostgreSQL, Neilson data, public data sets) pulled daily for BI and reporting on audience insights in their data warehouse. Instead of duplicating and </p><p>spending additional time in other tools preparing that data, they can access it from a single point of entry in watsonx.data. They can use the watsonx.data lakehouse engine to cleanse and transform data, reducing complexity and time to prepare data for AI and analytics use cases. Then without duplication, they can bring lakehouse data back to Db2 Warehouse or Netezza as part of their curated data set, ready for BI and reporting. </p>|

**101: Modernization and Augmentation**

Why modernize with IBM?

- Migrate with like-for-like compatibility (IBM only - Db2 to Db2, Netezza to Netezza)
- Fully managed SaaS offerings, or containerized deployments for self-managed software
- Independently scale up/ down storage or compute with ease
- Use object storage to save on storage costs

Why cross-sell/ augment data warehouse?

- Seamless integration with .data and IBM ecosystem to enable a single view of analytics and AI estate, without moving or duplicating data
- Share data through open-table and open-data formats
- Optimize workloads for AI with multiple open-source fit for purpose engines, reduce data warehouse costs by 50%
- Scale new use cases: AI/ML, Real-time analytics, data engineering, data sharing

Why cross-sell/ modernize data lake?

- Leave data where is and access through shared Hive meta-store
- Leverage advanced governance features with IBM Knowledge Catalog
- Optimize workloads with multiple open-source fit for purpose engines
- Easy to deploy containerized configuration
- Scale new use cases: AI/ML, Real-time analytics, data engineering, data sharing

What do I sell if my customer has:

- IBM analytics appliance?
- IBM Db2 Warehouse or Netezza?
- Db2 for z/OS?
