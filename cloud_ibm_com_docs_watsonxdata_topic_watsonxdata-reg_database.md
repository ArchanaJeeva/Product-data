A catalog defines the schemas and metadata for a data source. When you add your own object storage bucket or database, or query the data in these data sources through the query engines of watsonx.data, egress charges for pulling data out of these sources might apply depending on your service provider. If you are using managed services, consult your service provider's documentation or support for details about these charges. To reduce the latency issues, it is recommended to colocate your additional object storage buckets or databases in the region where watsonx.data instance is provisioned. IBM supports the following database types: IBM Db2: IBM Db2 is a database that contains relational data. IBM Netezza: Netezza Performance Server is a platform for high-performance data warehousing and analytics. Apache Kafka: Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. Connect to an Apache Kafka real-time processing server to write and to read Streams of events from and into topics. MongoDB: IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB is a MongoDB database that is managed by IBM Cloud. It uses a JSON document store with a rich query and aggregation framework. MySQL: IBM Cloud Databases for MySQL extend the capabilities of MySQL by offering an auto-scaling deployment system that is managed on IBM Cloud that delivers high availability, redundancy, and automated backups. IBM Cloud Databases for MySQL were formerly known as IBM Cloud Compose for MySQL. PostgreSQL: IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database that is highly customizable. Itâ€™s a feature-rich enterprise database with JSON support. SQL Server: Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system. Teradata: Teradata is a relational database management system. Elasticsearch: Elastic search is a NoSQL database that stores data in an unstructured manner. Snowflake: Snowflake is a cloud hosted relational database for building data warehouse. SingleStore: SingleStore is a relational database management system designed for data-intensive applications. IBM Data Virtualization Manager for z/OS: IBM Data Virtualization Manager for z/OS provides virtual, integrated views of data residing on IBM Z. It enables users and applications to have read or write access to IBM Z data in place, without having to move, replicate, or transform the data. Amazon Redshift: Amazon Redshift uses SQL to analyze structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes. It uses AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price performance at any scale. Informix: Informix is an enterprise class Object Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). It is extensible and provides extreme transaction performance and features to support both OLTP and Data Warehouse database services. Oracle: Oracle allows querying and creating tables in an external Oracle database. Prometheus: Prometheus allows reading Prometheus metrics as tables in Trino by using the Prometheus HTTP API mechanism. Custom: You can now use the custom database feature for databases that Presto supports but are not listed in watsonx.data supported databases.
