Itâ€™s part of Hubert Burda Media, an organization with a century-long history of shaping media landscapes and shouldering social responsibility. BurdaForward wanted to set up an automated assistant using generative AI (gen AI) to improve customer service and buying advice. BurdaForward partnered with IBMÂ® Client Engineering and IBM Expert Labs on a pilot to see if gen AI could be applied to transform its product review and recommendations into a mobile and chat first experience. The company was looking for a scalable conversational AI solution that could cover more than 1,000 products. IBMÂ® Client Engineering IBM Expert Labs Together, the team used the combination of IBM watsonxâ„¢ Assistant, IBM WatsonÂ® Discovery and IBM watsonx.aiâ„¢ to build conversational AI that advises customers on product questions in a semi-structured dialog and enables the purchase. The solution uses watsonx.ai to generate API request filters from natural language, and it uses watsonx.ai and watsonx Assistant to guide the dialog dynamically, reducing the modelling effort. And the solution is scalable to allow the onboarding of hundreds of products without complex action modelling. IBM watsonxâ„¢ Assistant IBM WatsonÂ® Discovery IBM watsonx.ai Â  Results indicated that customers were able to get to a selection of products that match perfectly to their personal criteria. The selection process is 10 times faster than it was previously, before the use of automated step-by-step guidance with gen AI. The entire conversation felt very friendly and at the same time goal-oriented for users, Â and as a result customer satisfaction increased by around 15%. In addition, the easy and time-saving way of creating individual chats with question-and-answer options increases the scalability of product recommenations throughout various categories.
