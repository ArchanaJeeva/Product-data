For two weeks in the late summer of 2023, more thanÂ 950,000 people made the journey to Flushing, New York, to watch the best tennis players in the world compete in the US Open Tennis Championships. Year after year, it is one of the most highly attended sporting events in the world. But more than 15 million global tennis fans follow the tournament through the US Open app and website. And to keep them coming back for more, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) has worked side-by-side with IBM Consultingâ„¢ for more than three decades, developing and delivering a world-class digital experience that constantly advances its features and functionality. IBM Consultingâ„¢ â€œThe digital experience of the US Open is of enormous importance to our global fans, and therefore to us,â€ says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer at the USTA. â€œThat means we need to constantly innovate to meet the modern demands of tennis fans, anticipating their needs, but also surprising them with new and unexpected experiences.â€ To help the US Open stay on this cutting edge of customer experience, IBM Consulting worked closely with the USTA to develop generative AI models that transform tennis data into insights and original content on the US Open app and website. The USTA used IBMÂ® watsonx, a next-generation AI and data platform to build the AI models supporting key app features such as Match Insights and the new AI Commentary for US Open highlight reels. IBMÂ® watsonx World-class digital experiences for more than 15 million fans around the globe IBM captures and analyzes more than 7 million data points throughout the tournament The US Open is a sprawling, two-week tournament, with hundreds of matches played on 22 different courts. Most of those matches are not broadcast on television, and therefore do not have any spoken commentary. So the USTA asked IBM to add spoken commentary to the video highlight reels that are produced for every singles match throughout the tournament. To do it, the IBM Consulting team built a generative AI solution, based on a powerful large language model called Sandstone, available through watsonx.ai. Sandstone already understands the English language, but it needed to be trained, or â€œtuned,â€ on tennis data in order to translate tennis scenes into complete sentences. â€œFoundation models are incredibly powerful and are ushering in a new age of generative AI,â€ says Shannon Miller, a Partner at IBM Consulting. â€œBut to generate meaningful business outcomes, they need to have domain expertise. And thatâ€™s why an organizationâ€™s proprietary data is the key differentiator when it comes to AI.â€ The team used watsonx.data to connect and curate the USTAâ€™s trusted data sources. The curation process includes de- duping and filtering the foundational data that informs the large language model, as well as the USTAâ€™s proprietary data. The process filters for things like profanity or abusive language and objectionable content. The AI Commentary model is then trained to translate the metadata attached to video clips into sentences. It generates dozens of different options before choosing the best sentence to describe the action, taking care to vary the sentence structure from clip to clip, so as to avoid repetition. Text-to-speech capabilities are then used to give voice to the words. Over the course of the 2023 US Open, match highlights with AI Commentary were viewed more than 2 million times. The operation of the model is monitored for performance using elements of what will be included in the upcoming watsonx.governance release. And the same suite of watsonx tools were used to build the AI models that power the Match Insights feature with IBM WatsonÂ®. These models produce AI-powered fact sheets using sophisticated data analytics and natural language processing to distill millions of data points into meaningful insights about all singles matches. For example, tennis fans can see which players have the most momentum in the tournament by checking out the IBM Power Index, which successfully ranked the eventual womenâ€™s champion #1 throughout the tournament, despite her world ranking of #6. And prior to each match, users can see which player has the highest likelihood to win. They can even see the relative difficulty of each playerâ€™s draw with the new AI Draw Analysis feature. To develop new capabilities every yearâ€”like the ones found in the AI Commentary and Match Insightsâ€”the USTA needs to move with speed and purpose. The process starts the week after the US Open concludes, when IBM Consulting kicks off work using the IBM Garageâ„¢ Methodology, a highly collaborative approach to co-creation. IBM Garageâ„¢ Methodology â€œWhen we engage with a client, itâ€™s critical that we work closely together every step of the way, ideating, iterating and adapting as we drive toward the clientâ€™s desired end state,â€ says Miller. In order to transform new ideas into digital reality, IBM Consulting designs, develops and manages a powerful digital infrastructure capable of processing structured and unstructured data, and integrating technology from a variety of sources. This foundational infrastructure is advanced and improved upon every year. â€œIt used to be that innovation cycles were measured in years,â€ says the USTAâ€™s Corio. â€œBut now, innovation is measured in weeks and days, and it can come from anywhere. So we needed a flexible platform that could handle all kinds of data, automate the process of turning data into insight, and do it all while protecting the entire digital environment.â€ The raw material of any digital experience is data, and the US Open tournament produces a lot of it. For starters, each US Open consists of 128 men and 128 women singles players, and a total of seven rounds for each tournament. Each tennis player comes with his or her own data set, including world ranking and recent performance. But thatâ€™s just the beginning. Over the course of the tournament, more than 125,000 points will be played. And each one of those points generates its own data set: serve direction, speed, return shot type, winner shot type, rally count and even ball position. All told, more than seven million data points are generated during the tournament. But to add more texture and context to the US Open digital experience, the team wanted to go beyond the numbers. So they are using AI to analyze the language and sentiment of millions of articles from hundreds of thousands of different sources to develop insights that are unique and informative, like the IBM Power Index. To help manage the collection, integration and analysis of the data sets, IBM used watsonx.data, a purpose-built data store specifically designed to handle AI workloads. â€œItâ€™s a massive data management operation, incorporating multiple sources of data and a variety of partners,â€ says Miller. â€œBut the magic happens when you combine hard data like stats and scores with unstructured data like media commentary. That is what gives tennis fans a more complete picture of each match.â€ To streamline this process during its years of work with the USTA, IBM Consulting has built automated workflows that integrate and orchestrate the flow of data through the various applications and AI models needed to produce the digital experience. These workflows are made possible by a hybrid cloud architecture and the containerized apps running on Red HatÂ® OpenShiftÂ®. The US Open hybrid multicloud architecture is made up of four public and three private clouds, drawing on data from a variety of sources and integrating features and capability from a variety of partners. Red HatÂ® OpenShiftÂ® By containerizing the applications, the team can write them once and run them anywhere, ensuring the right data gets to the right application on the right cloud. And to keep the entire operation running smoothly, the team uses IBM Instanaâ„¢ Observability technology, which constantly monitors application performance and surfaces issues in less than three seconds, so the team can take swift action and avoid any downtime. IBM Instanaâ„¢ Observability Over the course of the tournament, itâ€™s not unusual for the US Open digital platforms to be on the receiving end of millions of security incidents. The type of threat varies, but most are looking for a crack in the armor and are not serious. Defending the platform starts months before the tournament begins. Using the IBM SecurityÂ® Randori Recon solution, the team conducts a comprehensive attack surface analysis, scanning the entire network for vulnerabilities, including third-party or adjacent networks. Following this security reconnaissance, IBM Security Randori then ranks those vulnerabilities by their attractiveness to hackers, allowing the team to prioritize its response. IBM SecurityÂ® Randori Recon Once the tournament begins, the US Open uses the IBM Security QRadarÂ® Suite to assess the severity of each security event, evaluating threats, ignoring the insignificant ones and passing along only the most urgent issues to the security analysts. It then correlates that activity with threat intelligence from external sources, like the IBM X-ForceÂ® Exchange solution, looking for any activity that might be part of a more coordinated, global attack. And finally, the IBM Security QRadar Suite serves up recommendations to IBM analysts on how best to deal with the threat. During the 2023 US Open, the IBM team successfully thwarted more than 10 million security events. IBM Security QRadarÂ® Suite IBM X-ForceÂ® Exchange â€œWith this platform, weâ€™re capable of doing things that were not possible just a few years ago,â€ says Corio. â€œManaging all that data, producing AI-generated insights, securing the environment â€¦ IBM just makes it all come together for us.
