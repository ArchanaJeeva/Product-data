IBM and Red Hat deliver the full AI stack![](Aspose.Words.a13daeeb-a5b2-416d-a738-3c455e319e56.003.png) ![](Aspose.Words.a13daeeb-a5b2-416d-a738-3c455e319e56.004.png)

**watsonx.ai** is the next-generation enterprise studio for AI  builders to train, validate, tune, and deploy generative AI,  foundation models, and machine learning capabilities,  built on Red Hat OpenShift AI 

- watsonx.ai + Red Hat OpenShift AI deliver a complete 

  platform for managing AI workloads, training 

  foundation models and scaling AI deployments 

- Deploy watsonx.ai on-premises environments, private or public  clouds via Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform  
- watsonx.ai delivers high quality, governed, and trusted AI through  curated IBM-developed, third-party, and open-source models,  optimized workflows, and integrations to the wider watsonx and  Cloud Pak for Data platforms  

Why watsonx.ai and Red Hat? ![](Aspose.Words.a13daeeb-a5b2-416d-a738-3c455e319e56.005.png)

**watsonx.ai** and Red Hat OpenShift AI accelerate time to value through an optimized generative AI and ML workflow

- watsonx.ai customers gain full access to Red Hat OpenShift AI & Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to host, train, tune, and run inference on foundation models. This reinforces IBM’s commitment to open source for enterprise solutions
- OpenShift AI’s execution layer connects directly to the watsonx.ai UI, including the Prompt Lab, Tuning Studio, and a foundation model library with access to a variety of IBM and third-party models. Developers can also access watsonx.ai via APIs to gain lower-level control
