# Better together: IBM watsonx.data and IBM Db2
## Integrated to improve performance, reduce storage costs, and scale analytics and AI across your enterprise

Many organizations are harnessing generative AI at scale to transform their business and customer experiences. With IBMfi Db2fi and IBMfi watsonx.data , you can too.

The open and governed watsonx.data lakehouse platform is now seamlessly integrated with the next generation of IBMfi Db2fi Warehouse to optimize and scale your analytics and AI workloads, improve performance, 

and reduce storage costs.
#### About the next generation of Db2 Warehouse
IBM Db2 Warehouse lets you store and analyze governed data across a variety of sources, formats and analytics environments, while you reduce costs, improve performance and control resource consumption at scale.

`  `Achieve 4x faster performance and cut cost by 34x Db2 

Warehouse runs natively on highly resilient, cost-effective cloud object storage. Coupled with advanced caching techniques, your analytics workloads can now run 

4x faster while reducing storage cost by 34x.1

`  `Share data responsibly Share data in open formats 

and extract new insights across teams using a single, governed engine that supports integration with your lake.

`  `Scale analytics across the whole enterprise Db2 Warehouse 

natively integrates with the watsonx.data service to provide you with a singular view of your entire analytics and AI estate.
### With watsonx.data and Db2 warehouse, you can:
#### Extend warehouse data to your lakehouse
Gain new insights from your warehouse data by combining Db2 Warehouse and watsonx.data platform data through open formats engine.
#### Optimize workloads
Optimize costly warehouse workloads with fit-for-purpose engines that scale automatically. Run resource-intensive machine leaning (ML) model builds in your watsonx.data lakehouse without impacting business intelligence (BI) and dashboard workloads in your warehouse.
#### Share data through an open format
Eliminate data silos by sharing Db2 tables with data lakes and lakehouse engines through open table and data formats, such as Apache Iceberg, Parquet, Avro and ORC, and CSV, JSON, and more.
#### Curate data
Use the watsonx.data lakehouse engine to cleanse and transform data, reducing complexity and time to prepare data for model training. Easily bring lakehouse data back to your warehouse as part of your curated data set, 

ready for reporting, analytics and AI.

A single view of your analytics and integrated AI estate

### watsonx.data + Db2 Database
Db2 Database is a cloud-native database that provides a single place for DBAs, enterprise architects, and developers to simplify development of mission critical data and AI-driven applications.

Db2 Database and watsonx.data lets you use your Db2 transactional data in an open data lakehouse architecture and combine it with new data to gain fresh insights 

and deploy AI at scale.

Offloading Db2 transactional data to Db2 Warehouse or promoting data into a data lake storage like AWS S3 or IBM Cloud Object Storage allows multiple users to seamlessly share data with watsonx.data. Now they can leverage a single copy of data across their data ecosystem, including data science tools, data visualization tools and other data components

With access to watsonx.data s multiple query engines such as Presto, Spark, Db2, and Netezza, you can now choose to run your analytics and AI workloads on Db2 data with a fit for purpose engine.
#### AI/ML
Build, train, tune, deploy and monitor trusted AI models 

for mission-critical workloads with Db2 data in the lakehouse and ensure compliance with lineage and reproducibility 

of data used for AI.
#### Real-time analytics & BI
Connect existing Db2 data with new data in watsonx.data and unlock new insights without the cost and complexity of duplicating and moving data.
#### Streamline data engineering
Reduce data pipelines, simplify data transformation and enrich data for analytics and AI using SQL, Python or a generative AI conversational interface.
#### Data sharing
Support self-service access for more users to more Db2 data while enabling security and compliance with centralized governance and local automated policy enforcement through integration with IBM Knowledge Catalog.
