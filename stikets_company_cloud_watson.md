What parent has not lamented the fact that children often return from school without important belongings such as hats, gloves, notebooks and even textbooks? One such mother decided to solve that problem by starting a label-making company in her garage in Barcelona, Spain. Today, The Stikets Company, S.L. is a global company, selling its stickers and adhesive product solutions to families and businesses in more than 30 countries, using 15 languages and supporting 12 currencies around the globe. It provides specific marketing to 25 countries and offers support from help desks in the Philippines, Spain and Colombia. The company fulfills more than 350,000 orders annually, with many of those occurring seasonallyâ€”for example, during the back-to-school rush that takes place around the world. During those weeks, frantic parents request information from Stikets customer service channels, which Stikets supports using the Zendesk chat solution to connect customers with live agents. However, thanks to the companyâ€™s exponential growth, there could be long lag times between a customer request and an agentâ€™s response. â€œWe know that thereâ€™s a direct correlation between how fast you can solve a problem and the conversion rate,â€ says Antoni Ribas, Cofounder of Stikets. â€œYou need to convert a question or doubt into a sale, even if it comes in at two in the morning.â€ Highly capable AI Â  Stiky, the AI virtual assistant, resolves up to 90% of queries AI efficiency Â  Stiky conducts on average 165Â conversations daily High CSAT Â  Customer satisfaction rating: 92% positive Unfortunately, customers were waiting up to 24 hours for a response to even simple questions, reducing the chance that they would purchase from Stikets. It wasnâ€™t ideal for the companyâ€™s help desk agents, either. â€œWe want them to dedicate their time to solving the most challenging questions and guiding our customers into the purchase journey, not answering the same questions over and over,â€ says Ribas. Stikets decided to address this challenge by implementing an AI-enabled virtual assistant solution. Although Stikets employs only around 50 people, Ribas strongly believes that AI is critical to the future of the business. â€œI believe that if you donâ€™t have AI, you will be out of business in the next few years,â€ he says. But it wasnâ€™t just about finding a solution to a single problem. According to Ribas: â€œWe wanted to invest in the technology, not just in a solution. And to invest in the technology we had to work hand in hand with somebody who knows AI and is in it for the long term.â€ Thatâ€™s when the company found IBM Business Partner Enzyme Advising Group, experts in AI and digital transformation. Furthermore, because Stikets operates almost entirely in the cloud, whatever AI solution it found had to be cloud-based, compatible with its other systems and platforms, and scalable with the seasonal nature of the business. Enzyme recommended theÂ IBMÂ® watsonx AssistantÂ virtual agent solution, running onÂ IBM CloudÂ®. IBM Â® IBM CloudÂ® â€œWe saw that IBM Cloud would offer us the flexibility to start with a customized but dependable solution and scale it to what we do,â€ says Ribas. The IBM Watson Assistant solution would allow Stikets to minimize its infrastructure investment through a solution-as-a-service (SaaS) payment model. â€œThis is our first step into cognitive technology and artificial intelligence. But we know that this is not going to be the only one; this is going be the first of many.â€ Together, Stikets and Enzyme used IBM watsonx Assistant technology running on IBM Cloud to develop a custom virtual assistant nicknamed Stiky. The virtual assistant provides around-the-clock support to customers by answering frequently asked questions about products, shipping, pricing and more. The IBM Watson Assistant solution integrates with the companyâ€™s Zendesk application, which automatically creates help tickets that are routed to live agents for follow up. Enzyme used agile methodology, and Stikets initially trained the virtual assistant on several basic responses for its Spanish page, to deploy a first version of Stiky in just one week. Enzyme and Stikets then continued to enhance the solution, adding four more languages and training it to answer more complex questions. By mid-2020, Stikets had deployed the solution on 12 of its websites. Deploying the fully functional virtual assistant took just 10 weeks, including integrating Stiky with the clientâ€™s Zendesk platform. â€œIt was a base hit,â€ says Ribas. â€œEnzyme said it was going to take 10 weeks, and it did. I was very impressed by that.â€ Enzyme integrated its Enzyme Watson Accelerator technology, which is based on the Node-RED development tool, with theÂ IBM watsonx Assistant solution. The accelerator enriches the customerâ€™s inquiries with further intelligence. It defines input variables, contexts and conditions based on user input in Stiky, as well as outputs such as specific conversation behaviors and integration with other customer systems. It extends theÂ IBM watsonx Assistant functionality to include multichannel and multilanguage management and third-party integrations. â€œWe were able to do this very quickly because of the architecture ofÂ IBM watsonx Assistant and IBM Cloud,â€ says Isabel Celma, Director, Enzyme. Enzyme also provided the integration services to link Stiky with the clientâ€™s Zendesk solution to address the most complex questions that need help desk agent support. â€œWe are happy to say that the integration has been seamless, which is something that I was initially worried about,â€ says Ribas. Ribas was also impressed by the seamless integration of the virtual assistant with its other systems. â€œItâ€™s not just integrated into one system,â€ he says. â€œWe have a customized e-commerce platform and other systems, and we were afraid this would disconnect them, but it didnâ€™t. I have to really congratulate the Enzyme people on this as well as our IT department. It was a great effort on both of their parts â€¦ and they did an amazing job.â€ By working with Enzyme to develop a virtual assistant using theÂ IBM watsonx Assistant platform running on IBM Cloud, Stikets has increased its real-time support to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If Stiky cannot answer a question, the clientâ€™s integrated Zendesk solution automatically generates a ticket, which customer service agents answer by email, often in under two hoursâ€”even during peak seasons. Today, Stiky resolves 80% of all queriesâ€”up to 90% in Spainâ€”and conducts an average of 165 conversations daily. The virtual assistant covers a workload equivalent to 2.5 full time employees, freeing staff to focus on other, more pertinent tasks. After just a few months of use, Stiketsâ€™s integrated customer care system received a 92% positive customer satisfaction rating. â€œWe now have a much higher level of service,â€ notes Ribas. â€œWith Stiky, our customers are clearly getting 24x7 attention. Itâ€™s something that we didnâ€™t have before.â€ After launching Stiky, Stikets made some interesting discoveries about its previous levels of customer service. â€œWhen we analyzed Stikyâ€™s conversations, we discovered that about 55% of interactions occurred outside of business hours,â€ says Ribas. â€œI was upset. That meant that before Stiky, 55% of our customersâ€™ inquiries on our website had to wait till the next day or even Monday for an answerâ€”or the customers would just go to the competition.â€ The company also discovered that it had previously lacked the capacity to answer all the questions it received during business hours. â€œSo not only were we not attending to requests outside of business hours, but also within business hours we couldnâ€™t even reply to the amount of questions that were coming in,â€ says Ribas. â€œStiky put a stop to that.â€ The virtual assistant also helped the company prepare for the back-to-school season in Spain in 2020. Because of ongoing uncertainty surrounding the governmentâ€™s plans to reopen schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Stikets was unsure of when to gear up for the season. But, according to Ribas, â€œWe saw the traffic go up on the virtual assistant about shipping, even though nobody really knew when school was going to start.â€ When the government announced school reopening, Stikets and its customers were ready. â€œItâ€™s something that without the virtual assistant we would not have been able to see. It wasnâ€™t seeing the future, but it really gave us a sense of what the market wanted.â€ Ribas has big plans for Stiky and for theÂ IBM watsonx Assistant solution. â€œOur goal is to see that Stiky becomes a virtual assistant for customers, guiding them through the whole sales process and leading them there with the technology,â€ he says. â€œAnd we have plans to use the IBM Watson technology for different functionality, for example, applying it more broadly in marketing and sales.â€ As for a small company like his using AI technology widely throughout the organization, Ribas believes that now is the time for companies like Stikets to invest in AI and cloud technologies for the future. â€œFive years ago, it was impossible to afford or to take such a big risk because the price would be too high,â€ he says. â€œBut now itâ€™s gotten to a point where itâ€™s nonsense not to do it.â€ A big part of his decision includes not only the IBM Watson technology, but also Stiketsâ€™s growing relationship with Enzyme. â€œWe value the technology, the quality,â€ Ribas says. â€œBut in our case, itâ€™s also about the partner, not just about the technology.â€ In return, Enzyme also plans to continue and grow its relationship with Stikets. â€œFrom the beginning, they were really clear that they wanted to grow up in cognitive and in the cloud,â€ says Celma. â€œTheyâ€™re an agile company, and even though theyâ€™re small, they think really big.â€ Ribas concludes, â€œThis is the first step with Enzyme, and now we want to do many more projects.â€ Established in 2010 by a mom who needed a better way to label her childrenâ€™s belongings so they would not get lost,Â StiketsÂ (link resides outside ofÂ ibm.com) is a label manufacturer and distributor headquartered in Barcelona, Spain.
