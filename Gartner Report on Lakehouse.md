W hy Do Yo u Need Them All?

Strategic Planning Assumptions

Through 2024, enterprises using a cohesive strategy incorporating

data hubs, lakes and warehouses will support 30% more use cases

than competitors.

By 2025, 90% of new data and analytics deployments will be through an

established data ecosystem, causing consolidation across the data

and analytics market.

Drivers:

• Diversity of endpoint types.

• Analytical vs. operational data sharing and access needs.

• Range of users and SLAs.

Recommendations

Explore Lakehouse capabilities as a means of streamlining data

delivery through converged infrastructure and improved financial

governance.

Seek out the “line of good enough” in your lakehouse; today, dedicated

environments like a data warehouse may still be the best approach for

particularly demanding or complex workloads.

Use data lakes for analytics exploration and AI development; data

warehouses for optimization and broad consumption; or a Lakehouse

for both.

Prepare for continuous platform evolution with a data ecosystem

as business needs and available data management

technologies change.
