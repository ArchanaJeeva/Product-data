Get ready to scale analytics & AI with IBM watsonx.data

\================================================================



Hi[FirstName],

Organizations still struggle to make use of data for AI.  IBM recently shared an exciting new product announcement, IBM watsonx, a platform designed to scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data. 

Watsonx is built with 3 core capabilities:

• watsonx.ai - to train, validate, and tune AI models

• watsonx.data – to scale AI workloads for all your data, anywhere

• watsonx.governance - to enable responsible and transparent AI

AI starts with your data and how it is stored, managed, and governed in order to be trusted and scalable. [Watsonx.data](http://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data), built on an open data lakehouse architecture, can help you access all of your data for AI through a single point of entry and provides built-in centralized governance across your data ecosystem. It uses fit-for-purpose query engines to optimize analytics and AI workloads and significantly reduce the cost of your data warehouse by up to 50%.

How IBM watsonx.data can reduce your warehouse costs by up to 50%

\===============================================================

Hi [FirstName],



First generation data lakehouses have quite a few constraints when addressing cost and complexity challenges, such as: 



- A single query engine designed for limited workload types 
- No support for multi-/hybrid-cloud deployments
- Minimal governance and metadata capabilities 

IBM watsonx.data is the next evolution of data lakehouses and is the industry’s only open, hybrid, and governed data store that enables you to leverage multiple query engines to run governed analytics and AI workloads - wherever they reside! 



Check out this [**solution brief**](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/4Z1YXEBO) to learn how watsonx.data can help you reduce your data warehouse costs by up to 50% by optimizing workloads, all while accessing all of your data across your environments of choice.  



Ready to see how you can get started with [watsonx.data](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data) today? Feel free to reply to this email and we can setup a call to discuss your current data and AI strategy and how IBM can help.
