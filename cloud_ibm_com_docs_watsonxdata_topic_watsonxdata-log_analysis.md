Platform logs Platform logs are logs that are exposed by logging-enabled services and the platform in IBM Cloud. Configure a Log Analysis instance in a region to monitor these logs. For more information, see Configuring IBM Cloud platform logs. Viewing logs watsonx.data instances generate platform logs in the same region where they are available. You can view, monitor, and manage logs through the IBM Log Analysis instance that is marked as platform logs in the region. To launch the Log Analysis web UI to view these logs, see Navigating to the web UI. For more information about the locations where watsonx.data logs are available, see Service locations.
