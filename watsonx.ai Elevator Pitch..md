Elevator pitch – **watsonx.ai** 

**Build, train, validate, tune, and deploy AI models**

Why With organizations reporting a 6.3%1 increase in revenue directly attributable to their AI initiatives, it's clear that AI has the potential 

to drive significant business value. However, manybusinesseshave struggled with deploying AIprojects that see measurable value. A 2022 Gartner report noted that“Scaling AI continues to be a significant challenge,” and that on average, 54%2 of AI projects make it from pilot to production. The latest generation ofAIinnovation, foundation models and generative AI, has created a paradigm shift in how organizations develop, deploy and scale AI experiments in production.But other top challenges cited must also be addressed, such as a lack of tools or unified platforms to develop and refine models (25%)3, and too much data complexity (24%)3.

What To realize maximum business value fromAI, it is crucial for organizations to providetheir data scientists, developers, and business 

analysts access to high-quality, trustworthy data, anywhere – with a unified AI and data platform forbuilding and refining AI models at a pace to drive rapid business innovation to put AI to work – at scale and with confidence.  

How Clients and partners can build with our new enterprise studio for machine learning and generative AI, powered by foundation models 

spanning the AI lifecycle. With watsonx.ai, AI builders can train, validate, tune, and deploy traditional machine learning and new generative AI capabilities with ease and build AI applications in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the data. These models combine best-of-breed architectures with a rigorous focus on data acquisition, provenance, and quality, to serve enterprise needs. IBM’s open, hybrid, full stack approach includes a foundation model library with access to IBM-developed watsonx models, third- party and select open-source models from Hugging Face, a Prompt Lab to experiment with foundation models and build prompts for various use cases, a Tuning Studio to tune foundation models with labeled data, and a data science toolkit to build machine learning models automatically with model training, development, visual modeling and synthetic data generation – all running on a scalable, open and trusted, hybrid AI infrastructure. Clients can immediately get started withwatsonx.ai and co-create with IBM Consulting, Client Engineering, or IBM’s extensive partner ecosystem toaccelerate the value of AI for their business.

**Train, validate, tune, and deploy AI models**

Why Most businesses today are unable to realize full value from their AI investments. Even though 94%1of businesses agree that AI is critical 

to success, 50%1 of them are still achieving very low results as they struggle with deploying their AI projects. A 2022 Gartner survey indicates that 46%2 of AI models are never deployedor reach operational scale asscaling AI and proving positive ROIcontinue to be significant challenges.A new generation of AI foundation models has further fueled the imagination of what is possible and the urgency to accelerate the use of AI for greater productivity and growth.

What To realize maximum business value fromAI, it is crucial for organizations to providetheir analysts, business users, and data scientists 

with self-service access to high-quality, trustworthy data, and enable them to collaborate on a single platform forbuilding and refining both machine learning and new generation foundation models.**watsonx.ai** is the only platform in the market that provides
