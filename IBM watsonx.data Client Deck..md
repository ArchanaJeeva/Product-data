This environment leads to more cost and complexity for those who seek to govern data for AI.

Traditional approaches to addressing these challenges have created more overall complexity and cost, which has led to the emergence of data lakehouse architectures

**Early 2000s![](Aspose.Words.cde3a1f9-25ef-4fac-bbfd-20895b7014ee.011.jpeg)**

Today, leaders at most large enterprises manage their data 

and workloads using a mix of data repositories and data stores in hybrid environments.

The overall cost across all these repositories remains high.

It’s difficult for leaders to effectively leverage and govern the data across multiple environments and use enterprise data for analytics and AI.

- High up-front costs - High complexity - Data migration - Limited use cases
- Structured data only - Poor data quality - Vendor lock-in (BI only or AI & ML only)
- ETL required - Limited performance - High costs - Cloud only
- Vendor lock-in - Expensive to maintain - Limited AI & ML use cases - Limited governance
- Limited scalability
