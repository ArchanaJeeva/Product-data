**granite**

- granite-13b, granite-8b-Japanese, granite-20b- multilingual are priced at $0.0006/1,000 token

**llama 2**

- Llama2 13b ($0.0006/1,000 token) is the **BEST** pricing amongst the major platform providers
- Llama 2 70b ($0.0018/1,000 token) priced comparable to Amazon Bedrock and Azure

Perspective: the cost of summarizing a 30 min call to a one-page summary with llama 2 70b on Amazon Bedrock is 1.3X![](Aspose.Words.af121857-9928-48fd-b6a4-ee4154047cfc.021.png)1 higher than using the same model on[watsonx.ai \[](http://watsonx.ai/)[the math\]. The](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decoding-true-cost-generative-ai-your-enterprise-maryam-ashoori-phd%3FtrackingId=Rs%252BRANE6QDer5HcMfA%252Fetw%253D%253D/?trackingId=Rs%2BRANE6QDer5HcMfA%2Fetw%3D%3D) cost with OpenAI GPT4 will be 18.3X higher (6.6X if used GPT4-Turbo). If granite-13b or llama 2 13b are used for the same task, the cost of such task is going to be even less (3X less). Using a very large general-purpose model for this simple task is overkill. Hence, the importance of helping clients pick the right model for their target use case.
