Why do we care: The case for Hadoop modernization

1\. Organizations are trying to establish a strategy of post-Hadoop era.

Google Trends shows that interest in Hadoop reached

its peak popularity from 2014 to 2017. After that, we see

a clear decline in searches for Hadoop

Observing the Decline of Hadoop's Open-Source

Ecosystem

In April 2021, the Apache Software Foundation announced the

retirements of 13 big data-related projects, 10 of which are part of

the Hadoop ecosystem, such as Eagle, Sentry, Tajo, etc.

Now, Apache Ambari, born with the mission to manage Hadoop

clusters, becomes the first Apache project to be retired in 2022.

Why do we care: The case for Hadoop modernization

2\. Today’s data landscape is a lot different than

it was a decade ago

3\. Businesses across all industries are embracing

Gen AI

• Growing demand for quicker data analysis, the separation

of storage and processing, and integration with AI/ML

capabilities.

Businesses are adopting Gen AI for enhanced analytics, ML,

and AI-driven decisions, while Hadoop's batch processing

and third-party dependencies can hinder real-time analytics

and AI integration.

• Enhanced solutions for big data analysis that are user-

friendly and more efficient than Hadoop.

• Negate the need to deal with the complexities associated

with the Hadoop platform.

Challenges customers face with Open-source Hadoop

For years, practitioners have complained that Hadoop is too complex,

and that users must be experts in difficult-to-use tools to get useful data

out of it.

Complex technologies

Cost (licenses, maintenance)

Unsupported technology

Scaling

Customers using outdated versions of Hadoop were compelled to

upgrade at significant costs

Can result in operational risks, limited access to bug fixes or security

patches, and challenges in maintaining a stable and secure Hadoop

environment.

Hadoop poses challenges due to its monolithic nature, trapping

organizations with the initial version even as data volumes grow.

Cost optimization

Choose the right engine for the right

workload at the right cost, anywhere

without having to copy data to multiple

platforms while taking advantage of

integrated metadata.

Reason to Act

→ IBM and Cloudera share a vision

to store data on low-cost object

storage ->once the data is there it

is open for all

→ The IBM watsonx.data and

Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)

integration enables you to

augment your data lake with

warehouse-like performance,

optimize for cost with simple

object storage and multiple query

engines, and scale AI across the

enterprise with trusted data.

→ watsonx.data allows you to

access all your CDP data and other

data sources through a single point

of entry across all clouds and on-

prem environments.

Business challenges

• High volume of transactional data in

real-time

• Various sources of data leading to

duplication, migration, complexity and

time-consuming processes

• Challenges in supporting, maintaining,

and leveraging expertise for securing,

trusting, and governing data effectively

Use **watsonx.data** to unify data across

multiple data sources with zero- ETL for

new analytics projects
