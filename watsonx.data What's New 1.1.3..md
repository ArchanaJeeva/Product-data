**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**What are Vector databases? ![ref4]![ref5]

It is a database designed to store, manage, and search vector data, allowing for highly efficient and fast similarity searches. For example, in image or audio search, data with similar characteristics to a vector can be retrieved quickly.

**What’s the difference between a Vector DB vs Regular DB?**

A vector database is a collection of ![](Aspose.Words.0da8ae8f-a89d-427b-a3b8-fc604834d6c4.018.png)![](Aspose.Words.0da8ae8f-a89d-427b-a3b8-fc604834d6c4.019.png)![](Aspose.Words.0da8ae8f-a89d-427b-a3b8-fc604834d6c4.020.png)data stored as mathematical representations. Vector databases make it easier for machine learning models to remember previous inputs, allowing machine learning to be used to power search, recommendations, and text generation use-cases.

**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**Vector Database Use Case Examples ![ref4]![ref5]

You can use a vector database for Generative AI capabilities for use cases such as similarity search.

**Main Use Cases Description![](Aspose.Words.0da8ae8f-a89d-427b-a3b8-fc604834d6c4.021.png)**

Image/Video similarity search • Prevention of copyright violations when sending outside the company

- Search for similar images of diagrams/photos in external documents
- Efficient collection of similar images for creating AI models

Personalized service and  • Recommends information and products based on the user's behavior, preferences, proposal/recommendation systems profile, and needs.

- Recommendations can be generated by finding vectors that most closely match the user's interests.

Question and answer system  Vector search is essential to the use of Natural Language Processing and is used in (natural language processing) multiple applications, including chatbots. It allows users to interact directly with the 

system by asking questions that are vectorized and matched to the closest match.

By representing data points as vectors, vector search provides a better semantic understanding of the query and more accurate results for each user.
