**Achieve 4 times faster query performance and 34 times lower storage costs1** You might be wondering,  How can I reduce my storage costs but also improve my performance?  The next generation of IBM Db2 Warehouse SaaS brings a host of new capabilities that allow customers to scale their analytics across their entire technology estate while enjoying industry-leading price-performance:

`  `The solution introduces native support for cloud object storage based on Amazon 

Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for Db2 column-organized tables. Coupled with our advanced caching technology, cloud object storage helps clients reduce their storage costs by 34 times and improve performance up to 4 times1 compared to the current generation service. 

`  `Db2 Warehouse connects dashboards and reports with the power of fast ingest 

and querying capabilities for real-time insights. The solution speeds up analytics and reporting with a combination of in-memory and column-store data retrieval, maximized CPU processing and data skipping that allows for faster input and output for your data in the cloud.

`  `Db2 Warehouse is high speed, uses in-memory processing and allows for querying 

on compressed data. Db2 intelligently caches data that is required for a query execution, leaving the rest on disk.

**Share data responsibly and enable a single view across your** 

**analytics and AI estate** 

Db2 Warehouse now gives you the freedom to catalog, ingest and query your data the way you want to with support for open data formats such as Apache Parquet, Apache Avro and the Apache Iceberg open table format. This allows Db2 Warehouse to seamlessly integrate with watsonx.data, an open data lakehouse built to scale AI workloads and provide a common metadata store integrated with multiple query engines. For the first time ever, all your data warehouses and data lakes are stitched together to provide you with a singular view of your entire analytics estate.

`  `This new architecture also allows you to easily shift workloads and run fit-for-

purpose engines such as Presto and Apache Spark in watsonx.data that best meet your workload and price-performance needs.

`  `Db2 allows for governed data access and the distribution of data among 

users and third parties without data duplication. IBM [Knowledge Catalog ](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-knowledge-catalog)seamlessly integrates with Db2 Warehouse to provide centralized governance, quality and better compliance.

`  `Seamlessly integrate Db2 Warehouse with IBM business analytics tools 

such as I[BM Cognosfi Analytics. A](https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics)nd third-party reporting applications such as [Tableau, ](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/examples_db2.htm)[Microsoft Power BI, L](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/microsoft-power-bi-for-real-time-reporting-of-ibm-db2-data-a-step-by-step-guide/)o[oker and](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/db-config-ibm-db2-for-luw) SA[P, an](https://help.sap.com/docs/DB6)d ETL tools such as IBM [DataStagefi a](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2oc?topic=integration-datastage)nd I[nformatica ca](https://knowledge.informatica.com/s/article/567819?language=en_US)n also be integrated with Db2 Warehouse.

`  `Use governed data from Db2 Warehouse to build, train, tune and deploy your 

own ML models. Data scientists and engineers can also use familiar tools such as Python, R and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and train powerful machine learning (ML) models on their governed Db2 Warehouse data directly in the database engine, without the need for data movement.

**Optimize your costs through flexible workload scaling**

With Db2 Warehouse, you can take full control of your analytics costs with elastic scale and a cloud-native architecture based on object storage. The solution decouples storage and compute, allowing you to scale compute separately from the storage tier. The vast majority of your data will live in  highly scalable cloud object storage, with the option to land your row- organized data in block storage.

Customers can easily scale their data warehouse through the Db2 Warehouse database console. More exact control means paying less without sacrificing performance.

**Experience continuous availability and resiliency anywhere**

The Db2 Warehouse cloud-native architecture decouples computation and storage and features multiple layers of resiliency with managed computation, highly available storage and cross-cloud replication. If a compute node is 

in an unhealthy state, the cloud provider s native Kubernetes service IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service immediately detects the node, removes it from the cluster and delivers a new node from a hot standby pool that is provisioned just in time. Self-service snapshot backup and restore is supplemented by additional disaster recovery Db2 backups that are stored and replicated by the cloud provider s object storage.

Db2 Warehouse includes an adaptive workload management technology that automatically manages resources between concurrent workloads, given user-defined resource targets. Avoid unnecessary downtime or system latency with technology that helps ensure stable and reliable performance when tackling even the most highly concurrent workloads.

**Conclusion** 

With this solution, organizations no longer need to experience the stress of cloud vendor lock-in with multiple cloud deployment options. Take advantage of Db2 Warehouse as a fully managed service on IBM Cloud and AWS along with all of its core capabilities, regardless of the cloud provider  it s deployed on.

6 IBM Db2 Warehouse

1. Results derived from running the IBM Big Data Insights concurrent query benchmark on two equivalent Db2 Warehouse environments with  24 database partitions on 2 EC2 nodes, each 

   with 48 cores, 768 GB memory and a 25 Gbps network interface. One environment used the 

   new cloud object storage and advanced caching capability, and the other environment did not use the caching capability and was used as a baseline. The test revealed a 4x increase in query speed (213 seconds versus 51 seconds) using the new capability. Reduction of storage costs is derived from price for cloud object storage, which is priced 34x cheaper than SSD-based block storage.
