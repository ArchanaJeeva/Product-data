For a high-level view of the service types in IBM CloudÂ® and the breakdown of responsibilities between the customer and IBM for each type, see Shared responsibilities for IBM CloudÂ® offerings. Review the following sections for the specific responsibilities for you and for IBM when you use watsonx.data. For the overall terms of use, see IBM CloudÂ® Terms and Notices. Incident and operations management Incident and operations management includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery. Table 1.Incident and operations management Task IBM responsibilities Your responsibilities IBMÂ® watsonx.data instance administration Provide infrastructure operating system (OS), version, and security updates. Clean up all instance resources. Track hardware issues on running cluster. Create an instance using the provided API, CLI or console tools. Delete a service instance using the provided API, CLI or console tools. Customize a service instance using the provided API or CLI. View or change the instance configuration using the provided API, CLI or console tools. Application administration Monitor watsonx.data for any failures due to infrastructure provided by IBM. Run watsonx.data using the provided CLI, API or console tools. Tune the watsonx.data instance for your requirements using the provided CLI, API, or console tools. Observability Provide Log Analysis to enable observability of your IBMÂ® watsonx.data service logs. Provide integration with Activity Tracker to send IBMÂ® watsonx.data events for auditability. Set up Activity Tracker and send events to monitor the health of your IBMÂ® watsonx.data instances. Set up and send logs to Log Analysis. Change management Change management includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion. Table 2.Change management Task IBM responsibilities Your responsibilities Instance provisioning Order hardware (data plane in the IBM services account). Open the watsonx.data cluster to the internet (data plane in the IBM Services account). Ensure network isolation of the watsonx.data cluster nodes from other clusters (data plane in the IBM Services account). Patch the cluster hosts (data plane in the IBM Services account). Ensure safe erasure of data from removed node or deleted cluster nodes. Delete hardware (data plane in the IBM Services account). No change management responsibilities Identity and access management Identity and access management includes tasks such as authentication, authorization, access control policies, and approving, granting, and revoking access. Table 3.Identity and access management Task IBM responsibilities Your responsibilities Access control of the service instance through IAM Verify the user's permissions on the service instance before allowing access. Maintain responsibility for any service roles that you create for your instances. Security and regulation compliance Security and regulation compliance includes tasks such as security controls implementation and compliance certification. Table 4.Security and regulation compliance Task IBM responsibilities Your responsibilities General Maintain controls commensurate to various industry compliance standards. Monitor, isolate, and recover instances. Monitor and report the health of instances in the various interfaces. Secure cluster access through TLS/SSH (data plane in the IBM Services account). Integrate watsonx.data with IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). Set up and maintain security and regulation compliance for the watsonx.data instances. Disaster recovery Table 5.Disaster recovery Task IBM responsibilities Your responsibilities General Restore or rebuild the provisioning environments in the affected regions. Restore existing watsonx.data instances, where possible. Track instance state. Provision new watsonx.data instances in alternatively available regions. Ensure that the watsonx.data instance is stateless by making sure that all data, metadata and applications reside outside of the cluster. This activity must be completed before disaster recovery can be initiated. Provision a new service instance in an alternatively available region if the current instances can't be accessed.
