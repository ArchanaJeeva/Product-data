Competitor ![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.006.png)Overview (Weaknesses  not mentioned) 

All competitors are  relatively new companies  (within the past decade)  and are rapidly growing in  ![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.007.png)the public cloud market 

Competitor Overview

**Databricks** Databricks pioneered the term “Lakehouse”. It’s currently positioned as a leader in 

the emerging Lakehouse market. Founded in 2013 by the creators of Apache Spark, Databricks offers a unified analytics platform for a variety of use-cases such as data engineering, machine learning, data science, and AI.

**Dremio** Dremio has gained significant recognition for its proprietary Dremio query engine ![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.008.png)![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.009.png)

(Sonar) technology. It is positioned as a leader in the data lakehouse market, with a 

growing market share. Founded in 2015, Dremio offers an open, cloud-native data 

lakehouse engine that simplifies and accelerates data processing and analytics. **Starburst** Starburst has made a name for itself in the data access and analytics space. It is 

positioned as a leader in the enterprise data access market, with a growing market 

share. Founded in 2017, Starburst offers a cloud-native platform that enables fast 

and easy access to data across a range of sources.

**Amazon Athena** Amazon Athena was first released in 2016 and is the AWS data lakehouse offering that 

utilizes Apache Spark for analytics on data in open file formats and the Trino engine for SQL queries. Amazon Athena combines with other AWS services, like AWS Lake Formation, for data governance to build a complete lakehouse solution.![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.010.png)

**Snowflake** Founded in 2012, Snowflake has made significant strides in the cloud data 

warehousing market and is currently positioned as a leader in the cloud data platform space. Snowflake supports open table formats but locks clients into the Snowflake environment that is locked and controlled (not open-source based). It has a single SQL query engine and a limited ability to access data outside of a Snowflake data warehouse, and no hybrid cloud capability. ![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.011.png)![](Aspose.Words.be69b7c8-c981-4761-89b5-758e1e40bc4d.012.png)

**Amazon Redshift Spectrum** Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a Redshift service that allows direct queries on data 

stored in Amazon S3 files without having to load the data into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. Amazon Redshift Spectrum requires an active Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster to execute queries, so it is tightly integrated with Amazon Redshift and extends the data warehouse to access external tables in Amazon S3.

|||with Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, |
|||Power BI and other Azure services.|
||•|Databricks focuses on a cloud-only solution, with no on-premises product.|
||•|Databricks introduced its Photon engine to speed up SQL queries over their |

|||engine for SQL and DataFrame API workloads and delivers 3x to 8x performance |
|||gains over the previous query engine.|
||•|It’s built on open-source Delta Lake and Delta Sharing components, but Databricks |
|||has proprietary extensions to move clients to Databricks versus open-source.|
||•|In May 2023, Databricks announced an investment in the privacy and access |
|||control market. They invested in the modern cloud focused protection platform, |
|||Immuta, and acquired Okera, a data access and governance platform.|
|Dremio|•|Based on community driven standards such as Apache Arrow, Apache Iceberg,   |

|Snowflake|<p>•</p><p>•</p>|Snowflake has an extensive array of partners (200+) that help it provide services and functionality for data fabric and other use case capabilities that Snowflake lacks. Snowflake provides many data sets and applications from partners in the       Snowflake Marketplace. However, rather than providing data sets for usage,  Snowflake includes the data sets as part of a Snowflake data warehouse, driving additional data warehouse usage and a larger number of deployed data warehouses. Snowflake is moving into transactional data support with their Unistore hybrid table offering (in private preview as of April 2023) to be able to accommodate more types  of client workloads.|
| - | - | :- |
|Amazon Redshift Spectrum|•|Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a component of the Amazon Redshift data warehouse offering. Redshift Spectrum provides the ability for a client to query data within Amazon S3 files directly, without having to move the data into Amazon Redshift. Query processing charges within Amazon Redshift Spectrum are based on the amount of data processed by the query (not the query result). Amazon Redshift Spectrum by itself is not a data lakehouse solution as it can only work with data files within Amazon S3.|
