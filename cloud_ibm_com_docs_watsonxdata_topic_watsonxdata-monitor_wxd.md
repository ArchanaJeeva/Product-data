View metrics on the health of key watsonx.data components such as the metastore and engine. Also, understand the usage of your instances by actively running tasks and queries. You can use the IBM Cloud Monitoring service to monitor your watsonx.data instance. watsonx.data forwards selected information about your instance to Monitoring so that you can monitor specific metrics such as cpu and memory utilization. Set up your watsonx.data service instance To set up Monitoring for watsonx.data, you must create a service instance and then enable Platform Metrics in the same region as the watsonx.data instance that you want to monitor. If you have deployments in more than one region, you must provision Monitoring and enable platform metrics for each region. To set up Monitoring, From the IBM Cloud navigation menu, select Observability. Select Monitoring. The Monitoring pane opens. Either use an existing Monitoring service instance or create a new one. After the instance is ready, enable platform metrics by clicking Configure platform metrics. Select a region and then a Monitoring instance from that region. If you have deployments in more than one region, you must provision Monitoring and enable platform metrics for each region. Accessing your IBM Cloud Monitoring metrics To see your IBMÂ® watsonx.data customer metrics dashboards in Monitoring: From the IBM Cloud navigation menu, select Observability. Select Monitoring. Click Open Dashboard. Click Dashboards in the sidepane, open the IBMÂ® watsonx.data dashboard to view your watsonx.data metrics. For more information, see Monitoring Getting started tutorial.
