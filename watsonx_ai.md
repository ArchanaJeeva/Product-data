Now availableâ€”a next generation enterprise studio for AI builders to train, validate, tune and deploy AI models IBMÂ® watsonx.aiâ„¢ AI studio is part of the IBMÂ watsonxâ„¢ AI and data platform, bringing together new generative AI (gen AI) capabilities powered by foundation models and traditional machine learning (ML) into a powerful studio spanning the AI lifecycle. Tune and guide models with your enterprise data to meet your needs with easy-to-use tools for building and refining performant prompts. WithÂ watsonx.ai, you can build AI applications in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the data.Â Watsonx.aiÂ offers: watsonx foundation models Multi-model variety and flexibility: Choose from IBM-developed, open-source and third-party models, or bring your own model. Differentiated client protection: IBM stands behind IBM- developed models and indemnifies the client against third-party IP claims. End-to-end AI governance: Enterprises can scale and accelerate the impact of AI with trusted data across the business, using data wherever it resides. Hybrid, multi-cloud deployments: IBM provides the flexibility to integrate and deploy your AI workloads into your hybrid-cloud stack of choice. IBM Offers Metaâ€™s Llama 3 Open Models on Watsonx Chat directly with an LLM in the watsonx.ai 30-day demo. This demo does not include agents or simultaneous chat with multiple models. IDC Spotlight: The truth about successful generative AI Use cases Bring your own custom foundation models or work with a suite of curated foundation models offered by IBM. Experiment with open source models through the IBM and Hugging Face partnership to meet the needs of your business. Use open-source frameworks and tools for code-based, automated and visual data science capabilitiesâ€“all in a secure, trusted studio environment. Leverage foundation models and generative AI with minimal data, advanced prompt-tuning capabilities, full SDK and API libraries. Accelerate the full AI model lifecycle with all the tools and runtimes in one place to train, validate, tune and deploy AI modelsÂ across clouds and on-premises environments. Gen AI capabilities In the Prompt Lab, leverage foundation models to create better AI, faster. Experiment with different prompts for various use cases and tasks. With just a few lines of instruction you can draft job descriptions, classify customer complaints, summarize complex regulatory documents, extract key business information and much more. Quickly tune models for your specific business needs using the latest open source and IBM trained foundation models. Start your free trial MLOps capabilities Build models either visually or with code, deploy and monitor with end-to-end lifecycle explainability and fairness. Use MLOps to simplify model production from any tool and provide automatic model retraining.

Explore more client stories â€œWatsonx.ai proved to be very useful. In our research, we liked how it helped our customers (and our development team) to simplify tasks and extend the assistant knowledge without the need to pre-set the whole dialog in advance. It is a next level for us and our customers.â€ â€” Jindrich Chromy, CEO and co-founder â€œWith this tool, we will need only a quarter of the time compared to before to plan, write and publish an article.â€ â€” Madeline Scholz â€œIBMâ€™s commitment to cultivating an ecosystem of enterprise AI solutions based on their trustworthy and secure AI platform has proven highly complementary to our go-to-market strategy. We look forward to further cooperation.â€ â€” Tom Foley, Founder and CEO â€œWe are just at the beginning of this journey. This endeavor with IBM has reinforced our conviction that legal intelligence is on the brink of a transformative era, and Blendow Group is poised to lead this revolution.â€ â€” Johan Wallquist, Chief Digital Innovation Officer â€œWe are encouraged by the results of this pilot, and we look forward to the next chapter in our Generative AI journey. IBMâ€™s ethical and transparent approach to AI helps us put human values at the center of our transformation initiative.â€ â€” Alceu Meinen, Superintendent of AI and Customer Relations â€œThe IBM team has fully supported our patient-first approach that combines process research and process mining to establish areas of opportunity to improve the patient experience and outcomes. This has helped us to identify where we could pilot process changes and exciting new technologies to have an impact far more quickly than we would have before." â€” Professor Andy Hardy, Chief Executive Officer Take the next step to start operationalizing and scaling generative AI and ML for business.
