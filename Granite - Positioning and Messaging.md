**IBM Granite**

Trusted, performant and cost-effective AI foundation models built for enterprises

**1. Positioning Statement**

For enterprise clients looking to scale and operationalize generative AI cost effectively while mitigating model related risk and governance issues, IBM Granite is one of the most trusted and performant LLM based foundation models trained in accordance with IBM’s AI Ethics principles from a data set curated diligently to amplify enterprise relevant content , so that clients can bring generative and conversational AI use cases to specific business domains such as finance and legal with utmost confidence, reliability and trust.

**2. Messaging**

**Why?**
## Generative AI has surpassed the experimental phase, reaching a pivotal moment in business adoption with practical applications. A Gartner poll finds 55%<sup>1</sup> of organizations are already in piloting or production mode with Generative AI. 75%<sup>2</sup> of CEOs believe competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI and 50%<sup>2</sup> are now integrating generative AI into their products and services. CEOs say they feel over 6 times<sup>2</sup> more pressure from their boards and investors to accelerate generative AI adoption rather than to slow it down.
##
## Governance, Risk and Compliance are also top of the mind of business executives overseeing generative AI initiatives. 58%<sup>3</sup> believe that major ethical risks abound with the adoption of generative AI, and 79%<sup>3</sup> say AI ethics is important to their enterprise-wide AI approach.
##
Business executives together with their technology leaders are looking to scale and operationalize generative AI faster with trusted, performant and cost-effective foundation models, while mitigating model related risk and governance issues.

**How?**

Organizations should choose the right AI foundation models and deployment capabilities built for enterprise needs, so that they can bring generative and conversational AI use cases to specific business domains such as finance and legal with utmost confidence, trust and reliability. 

They should also choose a strong technology partner who understands key considerations, opportunities and risks in enterprise AI adoption, and bakes in AI ethics and regulatory preparedness across the generative AI lifecycle including foundation model development. 

IBM takes an **open** approach to developing foundation models through transparency in data curation and processing, creating **trusted** models with stringent data processing, governance and ethical standards, **targeted** at specific industry domains and use cases, and **empowering** AI builders with IP indemnification, model studio, and flexible deployment options.

**What?**

IBM Granite is one of the most trusted and performant LLM foundation models trained in accordance with IBM’s AI Ethics principles and in alignment with IBM’s differentiated approach to AI – Open, Trusted, Targeted and Empowering. 

The 13B parameter Granite base model is trained from a 2.5 trillion token data set curated diligently to amplify enterprise relevant content (from academic, legal, finance, coding, internet domains). IBM stands behind Granite models and indemnifies the client against third-party IP claims without a cap.

Granite Instruct and Chat models derived from the base model cater to a variety of enterprise AI tasks such as question & answering, generative tasks, insight extraction, summarization and classification. Given that a considerable portion of training data is from the finance domain, Granite models perform exceedingly better than its peer group of models in finance specific tasks. Our performance benchmarks also suggest that the accuracy of Granite models is on par with larger models (70B parameter+) at lower latency and infrastructure spend. 

The IBM curated pre-training dataset will continue to grow and evolve, with additional data reviews and will be added to the corpus at regular intervals. This sets the stage for newer foundation models from IBM including Granite series that are multilingual, multi-modal and attuned for specific business domains and use cases.

IBM will continue to push the frontier on AI with path breaking research and innovation in collaboration with leading institutions. With the newly launched [AI Alliance](https://newsroom.ibm.com/AI-Alliance-Launches-as-an-International-Community-of-Leading-Technology-Developers,-Researchers,-and-Adopters-Collaborating-Together-to-Advance-Open,-Safe,-Responsible-AI) - a group of more than 50 leading organizations across industry, startup, academia, research and government IBM along with Meta will support open innovation and open science in AI. This will further accelerate responsible innovation in foundation models and generative AI while ensuring scientific rigor, trust, safety, security, diversity and economic competitiveness.

One model cannot rule them all. According to Forrester, 85%<sup>4</sup> percent of enterprises will expand AI with open-source models. To help clients realize value from generative AI applications faster, IBM has made available a curated set of proprietary (Granite), open-source (flan) and third-party foundation models (Llama) in watsonx.ai to best fit their use cases at competitive prices. With watsonx.ai organizations can easily build, train, validate, tune and deploy foundation models in production for a variety of use cases in a secure, reliable, governed and cost-effective manner in the infrastructure (on-prem or cloud) of their choice. 

With watsonx.governance clients can manage, monitor and govern AI models from IBM, open-source communities and other model providers. They can proactively detect and mitigate risks by monitoring fairness, bias, drift, designed to help meet anticipated AI regulatory compliance requirements.

Accelerate the value of AI for your business with IBM Foundation Models library and the watsonx platform, in collaboration with IBM Consulting, Client Engineering, or IBM’s extensive partner ecosystem.
