**What’s new**

- New trade-up options for existing Cloud Pak for Data Enterprise edition entitlements to watson and watsonx.governance

**Strategy** 

- watsonx is our Generative AI    ![](Aspose.Words.4bb60a17-3aaf-4894-a1d6-a53250fbde82.003.png)
- watsonx.data – Datalake with AI integration AI

x.ai  o watsonx.ai - Gen AI and ML

- watsonx.governance  - AI Governance


**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**

- There are compelling cross-sell motions across 

  the watsonx and Cloud Pak for Data portfolios  • Cloud Pak for Data is our core technical foundation (e.g., watsonx.ai + Data Fabric) for delivering containerized software 

- Base platform for watsonx, Cloud Pak for Data and Cartridge portfolio ![](Aspose.Words.4bb60a17-3aaf-4894-a1d6-a53250fbde82.004.png)
- Primary delivery vehicle for delivering our Data 

DF o Added services like user management, security 

Fabric (Knowledge Catalog, DataStage etc.) enforcement, and install/update automation

- Extends the value watsonx – for example, GenAI requires high quality governed data

Highest yield opportunities with watsonx

Do I need to chose between CP4D and watsonx or can the offerings be used together?

- **Transition Edition is only available as a trade-up from Cloud Pak for Data**, net-new sales should use regular watsonx.ai parts
- Standard perpetual trade-up motion, includes 12 months of S&S for watsonx.ai so should be sold at renewal time

**Pricing Calculation** 

- Modernization Tool provides pricing calculations

***Note:*** The customer already has access to Cloud Pak for Data and would only acquire the trade-up if they wanted watsonx.ai. The Transition Edition exists to give customers a slightly longer migration window (similar to the Modernization Parts)
