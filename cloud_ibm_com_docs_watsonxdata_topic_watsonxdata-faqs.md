Pricing plans Where can I learn more about each pricing plan? watsonx.data as a service offers three pricing plans: Lite plan: It provides a free usage limit of 2000 Resource Units (monitored on the Billing and usage page of IBM Cloud) within a time frame of 30 days. The cap value is displayed on the IBM Cloud catalog provisioning page and is reflected on your billing page within your watsonx.data instance upon provisioning. Enterprise plan: You pay by hour for each infrastructure resource that you add. Start with support services then build the engines and services that you want. This has an hourly rate that is computed in Resource Units that maps to your payment method whether â€˜Pay as You Goâ€™ or â€˜Subscriptionâ€™. Enterprise BYOL plan: With the Enterprise BYOL plan, you have everything that is included in the Enterprise plan. If you have already purchased an on- premises watsonx.data self-managed environment (paid per VPC) perpetual or subscription license, you can choose to use the license to apply for a discount on your SaaS Enterprise usage. For more information, see Pricing plans. Lite plan Is the lite plan credit card free? Yes, if you use an IBM cloud trial account the lite plan is credit card free. You have a set amount of free usage limit of 2000 Resource Units within a time frame of 30 days, whichever ends first to try the product. For more information, see Pricing plans. What's included in the lite plan? The lite plan is provided for you to try the basic features of watsonx.data and is available to all IBM Cloud account types like trial, pay-as-you-go, and subscription. It supports the basic features only. It is not available on AWS and is limited to one watsonx.data instance per IBM Cloud account (cross-regional). Key supported features: Ability to pause and resume Presto engine. Ability to connect to an IBM Cloud-provided Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket and provide credentials to your own COS or S3 bucket. Ability to delete Presto, Milvus, and connections to your own bucket. Limitations: It is limited to provisioning a single instance per resource group. It is limited to 2000 resource units (RUs) before the instance is suspended. The cap value is displayed on the IBM Cloud catalog provisioning page and is reflected on your billing page within your watsonx.data instance upon provisioning. Your license expires on reaching either the cap limit of 2000 RUs or exceeding the trial period of 30 days. It is limited to a maximum of one Presto engine or Milvus service with starter size (1.25 RUs per hour) or both. It is limited to the smallest node sizes and profiles for each engine and service. You cannot increase the node size. The lite instances cannot be used for production purposes. The lite instances might be removed any time and are unrecoverable (no BCDR). Engine scaling functions are not available. What is the limit for using the lite plan? The lite plan of watsonx.data instance is typically a trial account that is free to use, with limits on capacity (2000 Resource Units), features for a time frame of 30 days. You can use the account to explore and familiarize yourself with watsonx.data. You need to create a paid IBM cloud account (either 'Pay as you go' or 'Subscription') and then provision an enterprise plan instance to access all the features and functions. I have exhausted all my resource units. How do I delete my lite plan instance? You can delete the lite plan instance from the resource group or IBM cloud resource collection will remove it after a period of 40 days. The lite plan has ended. How do I upgrade to the enterprise plan? Either before or after your lite plan has concluded, you can create a paid account whether 'Subscription' or 'Pay as you go' IBM Cloud. Now, you can create your new watsonx.data instance. The enterprise plan is available on IBM Cloud and AWS environments. You may create an enterprise plan instance once you have created a paid IBM cloud account (either 'Subscription' or 'Pay as you go') and then you can use a Cloud Object Store bucket that you own to store data. For more information, see How to create instance for watsonx.data enterprise plan and see How to use a Cloud Object Store bucket that you own to store data. How do I save data from a lite plan to an enterprise plan? You may create an IBM Cloud Object Store (COS) bucket that you own and connect it to your lite plan instance of watsonx.data. You can then write data to that COS bucket that you own. Then, once you have created a paid IBM cloud account (either 'Pay as you go' or 'Subscription'), you can create an enterprise instance of watsonx.data and connect it to the same COS bucket that you own to keep working with the same data files. Enterprise plan What is included in the enterprise plan? In addition to the lite plan, the enterprise plan includes the following features: You pay by hour for each infrastructure resource that you add. Starting with support services then build the engines and services that you want. This has an hourly rate that is computed in Resource Units that maps to your payment method whether â€˜Pay as You Goâ€™ or â€˜Subscriptionâ€™. Presto and external Spark engine and Milvus service. Hive metastore and Iceberg catalog. Infrastructure manager and query editor. Db2 Warehouse and Netezza integration. Ability to scale (increase and decrease) node sizes for Presto engines. Available on both IBM Cloud and AWS environments. What are the different payment plans under the enterprise plan? The different payment plans under the enterprise plan are â€˜Subscriptionâ€™ or â€˜Pay as you goâ€™. Is the cost for services like Milvus included in the enterprise plan? Yes, Milvus service is included in the enterprise plan. Bring Your Own License (modifications to pricing from enterprise plan) How does Bring Your Own License work? With the Enterprise BYOL plan, you have everything that is included in the Enterprise plan. If you have already purchased an on-premises watsonx.data self-managed environment (paid per VPC) perpetual or subscription license, you can choose to use the license to apply for a discount on your SaaS Enterprise usage. For more information, see BYOL Enterprise plan. You cannot use both the VPCs in your own environment and on SaaS. What platforms is it currently available on? Bring Your Own License is available only on the IBM Cloud platform now. What entitlements can I use for Bring Your Own License? The following are two parts that are eligible for a discount: 5900-AYS perpetual license 5900-AXD subscription software license FAQs This is a collection of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the IBMÂ® watsonx.data service.
