You can sync the object store (bucket) metadata with watsonx.data without moving the data physically. In Infrastructure Manager, click Add component. Click Add bucket. Enter the bucket details. Select Activate now. Select Catalog type as Apache Iceberg. Enter the catalog name. Select all the data present on the bucket to sync or create a catalog without any preexisting data. After registration, click the catalog and go to Sync logs. You can see the status of synchronization (success, failure, partial success) and the last sync time. After completing the synchronization, go to the Data manager. You can see the catalog that you created and the tables that are pulled from the bucket created by Snowflake. If Snowflake user makes data changes in the bucket and watsonx.data wants to pull those changes in the bucket, then click Sync data from UI for three strategy options: Sync all data: Synchronize all the data or update the existing table that was promoted earlier. Sync new data only: Pull the newly created table only. Sync existing data only: Update the table registered earlier to the latest changes only.
