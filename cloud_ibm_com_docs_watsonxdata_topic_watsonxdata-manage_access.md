A role is a group of permissions that control the actions you can perform in watsonx.data. To perform certain actions and manage specific sessions in watsonx.data, the user must also have the appropriate authorization. Authorization is granted by assigning a specific role to the user account. Use the Role Based Access Control feature in watsonx.data to grant users the access privileges they require for their role. Access to provision IBM Cloud resources is governed by using IAM access and account management services. You must have Administrator privileges to access the resource group in which you need to create the resources. To manage access, complete the following steps: Log in to the watsonx.data console. From the navigation menu, select Access control. Under the Infrastructure tab, the different components (Engine, Catalog, Bucket, and Database) are displayed in the table.
