**Lead Qualification Questions**

**Are you familiar with generative AI and ML? If so, have you ![](Aspose.Words.58175ea5-c724-4982-869c-4b251c7f6e2e.003.png)experimented with any foundation or ML models to-date?** 

- *Intention: This question is used to break the ice, find out how comfortable they are with talking about generative AI and machine learning. Is it chatGPT related vs. enterprise use?* 

**Who is responsible for working with AI/ML models today in your organization and what types oftechnologies are you using?** 

- *Intention: Understand their level of familiarity with existing solutions and level of expertise in the topic* 

**Where are you in your AI model lifecycle journey? How are you approaching operationalizing AI/ML inside your business?** 

- *Intention: This is a good opportunity to see if you can leverage their existing initiatives to find a way to insert watsonx.ai into the conversation*  

**What are the type of use cases and problems you’re trying to solve or thinking to leverage with AI/ML?** 

- *Intention: Understand the specific tasks, capabilities, and uses of* 

  *AI/ML capabilities they are looking /planning to work with*

**What do you/organization see as the critical considerations needed when determining an AI strategy?**

- *Intention: Listen for the approach the client is taking, are they mentioning the trustworthiness of the models, how unique business value will be created with AI, and the ability to infuse AI into existing business processes? How can we gear them to watsonx.ai?* 

**How are you coping with the shortage of skilled Data Scientists and Developers in the market?**

- *Intention: Learn about the challenges their organization is experiencing with lack of sufficient skills/roles/talent in AI/ML and how watsonx.ai can ease some of these pain points via access to automated AI/ML technologies and a simple interface to build prompts* 

**Any challenges you’re facing in deploying AI/ML? If so, what are they?** 

- *Intention: Learn about the roadblocks they are facing in terms of adopting AI/ML e.g., cybersecurity, privacy, or data accuracy reasons to weave in how IBM has a unique approach to solving AI governance to meet enterprise use* 

**How are you managing the costs andperformance of scaling these AI/ML models across your organization?**

- *Intention: Scalability of AI/ML workloads is an important aspect of the watsonx.ai solution, this is a good opportunity to learn about how they are approaching AI/ML solutions and if are they getting full value from their data/models due to cost and performance issues with inferencing, API calls, GPU load times, etc.*

**Can you describe the MLOps process you follow – is it working for you as expected? Can anything be better optimized?**  

- *Intention: Learn about challenges the organization is experiencing with the MLOps lifecycle to take models from development to production quickly and automatically – gear conversation towards IBM’s rich legacy in data science and machine learning – e.g. we’re a recent Leader in Gartner’s 2023 Magic Quadrant for Cloud AI Developer Services*
