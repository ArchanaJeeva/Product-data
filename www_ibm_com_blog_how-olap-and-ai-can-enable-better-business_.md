How OLAP and AI can enable better business Data and Analytics John Millar Thangaraj Online analytical processing (OLAP) database systems and artificial intelligence (AI) complement each other and can help enhance data analysis and decision-making when used in tandem. OLAP systems are designed to efficiently process and analyze large multidimensional datasets, while AI techniques extract insights and make predictions from OLAP data. As AI techniques continue to evolve, innovative applications in the OLAP domain are anticipated.Â  Defining OLAP todayÂ Â OLAP database systems have significantly evolved since their inception in the early 1990s. Initially, they were designed for handling large volumes of multidimensional data, enabling businesses to perform complex analytical tasks, such as drill-down, roll-up and slice-and-dice.Â  Early OLAP systems were separate, specialized databases with unique data storage structures and query languages. This siloed approach often resulted in data redundancy and complexity, hampering integration with other business systems. In the 2010s, columnar OLAP (C-OLAP) and in-memory OLAP (IM-OLAP) technologies gained prominence. C-OLAP optimized data storage for faster query processing, while IM-OLAP stored data in memory to minimize data access latency and enable real-time analytics. These advancements further enhanced the performance and scalability of OLAP systems.Â  Today, OLAP database systems have become comprehensive and integrated data analytics platforms, addressing the diverse needs of modern businesses. They are seamlessly integrated with cloud-based data warehouses, facilitating the collection, storage and analysis of data from various sources.Â  Challenges of adopting cloud-based OLAP solutionsÂ  Cloud adoption for OLAP databases has become common due to scalability, elasticity and cost-efficiency advantages. However, organizations face challenges when adopting cloud-based OLAP solutions, such as:Â  Data migration: Migrating large volumes of data to the cloud can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.Â  Network latency: Geographic distances between data and users can introduce latency issues, affecting query performance.Â  Cost optimization: Optimizing cloud spending for OLAP resources can be challenging due to complex pricing models and resource utilization patterns.Â  Security and compliance: Ensuring data security and compliance with regulatory requirements in the cloud environment can be complex.Â  Skills and expertise: Transitioning to cloud-based OLAP may require specialized skills and expertise in cloud computing and OLAP technologies.Â  Identifying best practices and benefitsÂ  In the realm of OLAP, AIâ€™s role is increasingly important. To build a robust OLAP system, it should provide accessibility regardless of location and data type. It should also support various storage formats, such as block storage, object storage and file formats like Parquet, Avro and ORC.Â Â  OLAP database systems have evolved from specialized analytical tools into comprehensive data analytics platforms, empowering businesses to make informed decisions based on insights from large and complex datasets. Organizations can expect to reap the following benefits from implementing OLAP solutions, including the following.Â Â  1.
