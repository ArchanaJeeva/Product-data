Figure 1. Fit-for-purpose query engines help drive analytics costs down with lower-cost compute and storage as well as fit-for-purpose analytic engines, such as Presto and Spark, that dynamically scale up and down.

**Connect to data in minutes**

Connect existing data with new data in minutes and unlock new, trusted insights without the cost and complexity of governing, duplicating and moving data. Users can explore and transform data using common SQL. 

Watsonx.data also supports integration with a robust ecosystem of IBM and third- party technology to help simplify development and deployment of your analytics workloads and maximize value from existing data investments. Watsonx.data 

is readily accessible through SaaS on IBM Cloud® and Amazon Web Services or as containeried software. Seamlessly deploy across any cloud or on-premises environment in minutes with workload portability through Red Hat® OpenShift®.

**Share a single copy of data**

Openness facilitates collaboration. It can also improve data integrity and help address security risks by reducing the number of copies of data required to support different users and tools. And fewer copies means less software, reduced hardware requirements and lower storage costs. With watsonx.data, you can access all of your data across both databases and data lakes. Share large volumes of data through open table formats such as Apache Iceberg, built for high-performance analytics and large-scale data processing. Support multiple vendor open formats for analytic datasets while allowing different engines to access and share the same data at the same time using tools such as Parquet, Avro, Apache ORC and more. Rely on watsonx.data to share metadata among multiple query engines using a single 

copy of data for all analytics and AI workloads.

**Optimize workloads with fit-for-purpose query engines**

No single analytics engine can deliver on the breadth of demands that satisfy all analytics requirements. Fulfilling such a wide variety of analytics requirements requires multiple analytics engines.

You can optimize costly warehouse workloads and help reduce data warehouse costs by up to 50% through workload optimization using cost-effective object storage and fit-for-purpose query engines.2 These include Presto, optimized for  BI workloads, and Spark, optimized for machine learning and data science (ML/DS) workloads—both of which scale up or down automatically as your needs change. With just a few clicks, you can quickly add a new query engine of your choice to meet your price-performance requirements.

**Prepare and manage data for AI**

Trusted, governed data is essential for ensuring the accuracy and relevance of AI applications. One way to prepare data for AI is by creating vectorized embeddings for low-latency queries. This unlocks large volumes of enterprise data for gen AI and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) use cases at scale. Watsonx.data features embedded Milvus vector databases that let you store  and query vectoried embeddings for RAG use cases. This feature helps ground AI applications in trusted data, enhancing the relevance and precision of  your outputs.
