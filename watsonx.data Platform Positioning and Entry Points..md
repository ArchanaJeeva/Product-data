`    `Traditional approaches to addressing these challenges have created more overall     complexity and cost, which has led to the emergence of![](Aspose.Words.99c342d5-3e94-484e-a31e-2272558fd0d8.004.jpeg) data lakehouse architectures

**Early 2000s**

Today, leaders at most large enterprises manage their data 

and workloads using a mix of data repositories and data stores in hybrid environments. 

The overall cost across all these repositories remains high.

It’s difficult for leaders to effectively leverage and govern the data across multiple environments and use enterprise data for analytics and AI.

Market dynamics

Major disruptions are driving the growth in the analytics repositories market **from on-prem to SaaS** and **from proprietary to open** technologies

Lakehouse Benefits and Challenges![](Aspose.Words.99c342d5-3e94-484e-a31e-2272558fd0d8.062.jpeg)

First generation lakehouses are still limited by their ability to address cost and complexity challenges:![ref6]![ref7]![ref8]

- Single query engines set up to support limited workloads –typically just BI or ML
- Typically deployed over cloud only with no support for multi-/hybrid -cloud deployments
- Minimal governance and metadata capabilities 

  to deploy across your entire ecosystem
