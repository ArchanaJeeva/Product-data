Guiding Principles: Three-in-a-Box Engagement

Step 1 **IBM Consulting (IBMC)** connects and collaborates 

with  IBM Technology (IBMT) and Client Engineering (CE) via ISC ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.003.png)

Step 2 **Client Engineering** create (or update) a Project in Financial 

Force and link it to the watsonx IBMC opportunity in ISC ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.004.png)Step 3 **Client Engineering** create / edit the CE Activity record in the 

Project in Financial Force to enable accurate dashboard 

reporting

Step 4 **Market Teams** use the Executive Topsheet and Campaign 

Dashboards to view Pilot activity![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.005.png)

**Q: What qualifies as a watsonx pilot?**

**A:** 4-6 week client engagement where IBM Technology, Client Engineering & IBM Consulting collaborate with our clients to deliver business results leveraging watsonx + and foundation models focused on 1 or more use case(s) that have a IBMT for product and IBMC opportunity for services in ISC.![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.010.png)

**Q: When can CE open a project and pilot activity in Financial Force for IBM Consulting?**

**A:** First, meet with your ‘3-in-a-box’ colleagues to review the watsonx account plan for your account. Next ensure Consulting has asked the client to allow IBM to deliver a pilot for them demonstrating watsonx capabilities. After getting clients agreement to do a pilot (free of charge) then IBMC creates DSR requesting CE resources and to initiate creation of pilot activity. CE then creates the project with pilot activity using IBMC related product (Red Hat L30). ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.011.png)

**Q: How far in advance can we create a pilot activity in Financial Force for Consulting-led pilots?**

**A:** As long as the two requirements above have been met, CE can create a pilot project using IBMC related product (Red Hat L30) NQ+2 out in the engage phase.![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.012.png)

**Q: Who is responsible to update/maintain a Consulting-led pilot project?**

**A:** IBM Consulting has edit access to Financial Force which will allow a few people in each geo to update pilot records. Please continue to work in your ‘3-in-a-box’ model to ensure everyone is aware of changes to pilot dates, scope, etc.

**Q: Do pilots that do not include IBMC or IBMT or CE involvement/participation need to be in Financial Force?**

**A:** Yes, pilot projects should be created for all pilots even if one of the ‘3-in-a-box’ model participants is not participating in pilot. CE will create the pilot project on behalf of IBMT or IBMC.![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.013.png)

**Q: What if the pilot is billable to the client?**

**A:** Follow additional guidance located here.

Step 2 First, let’s take a look at an IBM Consulting watsonx opportunity in ISC and check that ![ref1]

the seller has followed the instructions in the ISC Guidance web page (Step 1)...

**Client Engineering  ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.020.png)![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.021.png)create (or update) a  Project in Financial  Force and link it to  the watsonx  opportunity in ISC** 

There are 2 DSRs in place and CE have already     created a Project in       Financial Force

The first DSR is to request CE support for the Pilot. ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.022.png)

The second DSR is to request funding approval.

![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.023.png)

Next we will take a look at the CE Project in FF

Step 3 We need to create a ‘link’ between the IBM Consulting ISC opportunity and the CE Project in Financial Force. ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.024.png)

This will enable the details of the Pilot to be seen on the Campaign Dashboard / Executive Topsheet. Client Engineering do this by creating / editing a **CE Activity** in the Project record…

**Client Engineering  ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.025.png)create / edit the CE  Activity record in the  Financial Force  Project to enable  accurate dashboard  reporting** 

Here we have an example of a CE Project that is already created and is already linked to a ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.026.png)**Technology** opportunity in ISC. This is business-as-usual.

To connect the CE Project to both the Technology opp **and** the IBM Consulting opp, we:

1. Leave the Opportunity field alone – it already points at the existing **Technology opportunity**
1. Edit the existing CE Activity and point it at the **IBM Consulting** opportunity.   Ensure the Start and Due date match the provided pilot start and end dates from IBMC.

   …these actions will enable the CE Project to be connected to both Technology and IBM Consulting in the ISC Dashboard.


**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**Step 3 CE need to edit the existing CE Activity in the Project (or create and edit if one does not exist) and point it at the IBM Consulting opportunity, making sure the Opportunity Product is the Red Hat L30 entry…![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.027.png)

Copy the Opportunity Product Name entry from the opportunity ![](Aspose.Words.d87cb841-15c5-4ff6-9552-58d8f25c63b5.030.png)![ref2]
