CIO Organization Pilot

Challenge

Solution

The Hybrid Cloud Platforms team within

the IBM Chief Information Officer (CIO)

Organization is responsible for delivering,

securing and modernizing an immense,

diverse IT environment that powers

applications used by hundreds of thousands

of IBMers every day. The team is always

looking for new ways to streamline and

automate tedious, repetitive IT maintenance

tasks that are required across the entire IT

estate. This is why the team relies on industry

-leading technologies such as Red Hat®

Ansible® Automation and why, when

the Technical Preview of IBM® watsonx™

Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible

Lightspeed began, they volunteered

to test out the solution.

When they began testing watsonx Code

Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed,

Epstein’s team started by focusing on their

existing use cases.

With watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat

Ansible Lightspeed, developers can build a

task for an Ansible Playbook using natural

language inputs. Once the input is submitted,

the solution then offers suggestions on how

to build that task. During the technical

preview of watsonx Code Assistant for Red

Hat Ansible Lightspeed, the team was able

to achieve 60% initial build of an Ansible

Playbook using recommendations provided

by watsonx.

Cogniware: Revolutionizing

unstructured data analysis

and investigation to fight

fraud and organized crime

Challenge

Solution

Cogniware’s analytics platform needed a

way to collect all these different types of

data from customers and link them directly

into its Argos platform while also meeting

security requirements. The team believed

this could greatly speed up the time it takes

to process customer data and, more

importantly, shorten the amount of time it

takes to implement the product with each

new customer.

Building on its longstanding collaboration

with IBM, Cogniware partnered with the

IBM® Client Engineering and Technical Sales

teams from the Czech Republic to integrate

its Argos solution with [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data)[ ](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data)[watsonx.data™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data)[.](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data)

Argos is a secure and user-friendly data

analytics solution for investigation, deep dive

analysis, pattern searching and more. IBM

watsonx.data is a platform for analytics

processing of structured, semi-structured

and unstructured data. The integrated

solution is designed to help users collect

various different types of data—for example,

NOSQL, JSON, CSV formatted data—safely

and easily using watsonx.data, and then

connect the data to Argos Investigation.

With Argos, users can then visualize

connections and examine the activities

of individuals who are involved in an

investigation. The platform is designed to

make it easier for users to surface insights

that support their investigations.

Sensors, signals and synergy:

Enhancing Downer’s data

exploration with IBM

Challenge

Solution

By at least 4 times

aimed to accelerate the detection

of transportation anomalies within

4 weeks

In the realm of urban transportation,

precision is pivotal. Downer, a leading

provider of integrated services in Australia

and New Zealand, considers itself a guardian

of the elaborate transportation matrix, and it

continually seeks to enhance its operational

efficiency. With over 200 trains and a

multitude of sensors, Downer has

accumulated a vast amount of data.

IBM introduced Downer to the realm where no

-code and low-code solutions could build

predictive models to provide faster insights.

Downer was able to streamline modeling

times with watsonx.ai functionality (deployed

on IBM Cloud®), making anomaly detection

more efficient.

From 2 months

to 1 week

significantly decreased the time

to detect faulty sensors

Downer was able to rapidly develop predictive

models that harness both business expertise

and advanced time series forecasting and

anomaly prediction techniques, allowing for

the integration of these models into business

operations to enhance decision-making

processes.

While Downer regularly uncovers actionable

insights from their data, their partnership with

IBM® Client Engineering aimed to explore the

additional potential of this vast dataset,

focusing on certain tools and methodologies

that could streamline their analytic processes.

the results were not what was expected.

In many cases, employees had difficulty

their own, so they sought help from their

supervisors or colleagues, asking for search

keywords or hints on where to find them.
