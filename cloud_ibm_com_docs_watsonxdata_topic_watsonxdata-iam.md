Every user that accesses the watsonx.data service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM role. Review the following roles, actions, and more to help determine the best way to assign access to watsonx.data. The access policy that you assign users in your account determines what actions a user can perform within the context of the service or specific instance that you select. After you define the scope of the access policy, you assign a role. Platform management roles enable users to perform tasks on service resources at the platform level. For more information about platform management roles, see Platform management roles. For more information about IAM access, see IAM access. The following table describes the privileges that you can assign to platform management roles and associated permissions for watsonx.data service: watsonx.data formation Table 1.
