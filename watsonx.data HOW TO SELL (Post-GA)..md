Today, enterprises are faced with multiple data challenges

**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**

More data![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.004.png)

Exploding data growth

The aggregate volume of data stored is set 

to grow over **250%** in the next five years

In multiple locations

Multiple locations, clouds, applications and silos![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.005.png)

**82% of enterprises** are inhibited by data silos

In complex forms

Documents, images, video, and more![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.006.png)

Data management market drivers

**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**

- Public cloud SaaS is overtaking on-prem.
- Transactional/operational systems represent the largest segment of the databases market, with **$41B, 12% CAGR** (‘21-’25).
- The warehouse & data lake market is $23B, 17% CAGR (‘21-’25) and almost all the growth is coming from public cloud SaaS and the data lake segment.

![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.009.png)

- Enterprises look to open source to: 
1. reduce license costs, ![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.010.png)
1. leverage community innovation and support, and
1. avoid vendor lock-in. Open source provides fit-for purpose technologies for diverse data types.

The data warehouse remains the center  ![ref4]of analytics at most organizations 

**Late 1990s Early 2000s Present** • Data warehouses emerged as the dominant ![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.014.png)![ref5]

**Data warehouse** method to analyze data

- Normalized and trusted data made it easy to analyze, however it’s![ref6]

  an expensive choice

- Warehouses technology has evolved continuously to improve… from appliance form factors to ![ref7]

High up-front costs in-memory technologies Structured data only

The emergence of the data lake ![ref4]

- As volume, velocity, and variety of data grew, data lakes emerged as the new

data warehouses

**Data warehouse ![ref5]**

- Data stored in raw and unstructured format = ![ref6]

**Data Lake** lower cost for large 

volumes of data

- Highly flexible and scalable

![ref7] • Difficult to use & complex 

to maintain, and required a data scientist

High up-front costs High complexity 

Structured data only Poor data quality • Ultimately, most data lakes ETL required Limited performance failed and required a two- Vendor lock-in Expensive to maintain tier architecture

Limited scalability

Cloud data warehouses evolved to address  ![](Aspose.Words.36b4495d-5d3d-4f66-a3bc-687e32086cd2.019.png)
