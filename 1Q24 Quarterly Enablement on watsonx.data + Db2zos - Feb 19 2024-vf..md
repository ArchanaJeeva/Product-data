Unlock the mainframe data for BI and AI/ML use cases easily and cost-effectively.

**Challenge**

- Client is challenged to get mainframe data to downstream analytical tools
- Today, it is a time consuming and expensive process to make mainframe VSAM files available to cloud-based data warehouses

**Why IBM**

- Presto + DVM allows the virtualization and easy access to VSAM files, from watsonx.data
- Leverage mainframe data without migration or transformation
- BI using Presto + Cognos
- Allows sharing of this data with Snowflake, which is an existing investment

Collect, integrate and transform data from multiple sources to create data products/assets, and make it shareable with other government agencies.

**Challenge![](Aspose.Words.ed2932a1-bc04-4752-af5a-f8c7eee4b8c6.018.png)**

- Enable the local government agency to send/receive data to/from other agencies and public services, through national digital platform for data interchange (PDND)
- Lack of Data Lake or Data Lakehouse platforms
- Data spread across applications silos

**Why IBM**

- Fit for purpose compute engine allows vast array of analytics, using both Presto and Spark
- Highly scalable cloud native microservices architecture
- Inexpensive storage based on Amazon S3, highly scalable and unlimited capacity
- ML and AI available out of the box
- Quickly start with customer’s own data –no migration

USCG wants to modernize their monolithic, on-prem Postgres GIS database system with a hybrid data lakehouse to better support growing data needs and AI /ML Frameworks. 

**Challenge![](Aspose.Words.ed2932a1-bc04-4752-af5a-f8c7eee4b8c6.019.png)**

- Monolithic architecture, on-prem in block storage, storing geospatial data
- High maintenance and data storage costs, while also limiting USCG’s ability to scale with growing data volume and velocity

**Why IBM**

- Worked closely with partner Krozak Technologies, modernize to AWS, using watsonx.data + S3 + Glue
- With watsonx.data query engines and CP4D integration,  achieved data crawling and ingestion, high performance querying using Spark and Presto
- Solution proved watsonx.data + CP4D represents the type of scalable data and AI platform the USCG Intelligence Branch requires for data intensive use cases
