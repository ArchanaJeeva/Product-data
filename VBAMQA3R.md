and machine learning.

Components of the watsonx.ai studio

A well-considered approach to AI can help you scale and

operationalize more quickly and more effectively. The IBM

approach is to combine generative AI with traditional machine

learning techniques. Generative AI provides scalability

through foundation models that are trained on unlabeled data.

Traditional machine learning techniques offer ﬁne-tuning and

customization, using labeled data for improved accuracy.

Generative AI

– Manage tasks such as content generation and extraction

with foundation model libraries and use IBM-selected

open-source models from Hugging Face.

– Use prompts to summarize documents, create content

for marketing campaigns, extract information from

unstructured text, and more.

Meet IBM watsonx.ai™, an enterprise-ready AI studio for AI

builders. Build with our new studio for foundation models,

generative AI and machine learning. With watsonx.ai users

can leverage foundation models in a variety of ways including

accessing open source models, IBM proprietary models,

domain speciﬁc models, and bring your own models.

– Use APIs and SDKs to integrate generative AI

with applications.

Machine learning

– Build, train and deploy machine learning models with

an MLOps collaborative studio.

Build AI applications

in a fraction of the time,

with a fraction of the data.

– Construct solution engines for mathematical and constraint

programming to address decision-optimization use cases.

– Automate data preparation, model development,

feature engineering and hyper-parameter optimization.

– Create data preparation and predictive machine learning

pipelines with visual modeling.

– Generate privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data to

address data gaps, identify new insights, and train AI models.

– Get complete API and SDK for application integration.

Guide models to meet your needs

using tools for building and reﬁning

performant prompts in the Prompt Lab.

Tune models with your enterprise

data in just 5 clicks; your data and

models remain yours, private and

secured in the Tuning Studio.
