**Evaluation Warning : The document was created with Spire.Presentation for Python**Key Questions and Answers

**What are Red Hat OpenShift AI and watsonx?**

**Red Hat OpenShift AI (OpenShift AI)**:** 

OpenShift AI in turn adds High Availability capabilities, and model lifecycle management (i.e., model serving, training, etc.) across containers, to RHEL AI. OpenShift AI has been embedded within watsonx.ai. 

**watsonx.ai**:** 

IBM watsonx.ai adds access to a variety of both open source and proprietary models (such as Llama 3, Mistral, other popular 3rd party models), an enterprise-ready studio and other tooling for building end-to-end AI solutions, including out-of-the-box integration with other watsonx products, and other enterprise AI capabilities designed to help scale generative AI. IBM watsonx.ai helps make the inferencing engine and scale provided by Red Hat accessible to enterprise applications, workflows, and tools. 

**What is the technical relationship between Red Hat’s offerings and IBM’s? When will watsonx.ai be integrated with OpenShift AI?**

IBM watsonx.ai is available today, and provides access to (optionally installable) Red Hat OpenShift AI.  With watsonx.ai v2.0 release at the end of H1 2024, watsonx.ai will embed OpenShift AI to replace the current infrastructure layer and OpenShift AI will become a technical pre-requisite for the Foundation Model capabilities of watsonx.ai.

- At present, clients can install OpenShift AI using the following [instructions.  In ](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-datascience)future releases (targeted for watsonx.ai version 2.0), OpenShift AI is a prereq installed before watsonx.ai deployment
- watsonx.ai 2.0 will support all the features of OpenShift AI

Separately, Red Hat will launch RHEL AI in H2 2024, after which point, RHOAI will embed RHEL AI, meaning that watsonx.ai will both commercially and technically embed RHOAI, which will embed RHEL AI. 

See [FAQ](https://ibm.seismic.com/app/#/doccenter/861ea1fd-99e0-44d7-9135-85412e5c28d1/doc/%252Fdd3359e5f7-a856-a91b-7688-41024b2ac637%252FdfNTY4NmVhOWItY2RkNS04ZWY3LTZkNzItZTQwZjczMWUyMjk1%252CPT0%253D%252CRGF0YSBhbmQgQUk%253D%252FdfOthers%252FdfOTRiYmU4NTQtNWY4NC03Y2QyLWZjYWUtOGIxYmFmZjkyZThk%252CPT0%253D%252CUXVlc3Rpb24gYW5kIGFuc3dlcg%253D%253D%252Flfdb4780ad-c8ea-4a66-9a50-88276e37b3db//?mode=view&parentPath=sessionStorage) for further information

**If a client is interested in a Red Hat offering like OpenShift AI, why would they seek watsonx.ai?** 

IBM watsonx.ai addresses the needs of technical and line-of-business user roles in a single collaborative studio interface to support end-to-end AI workflows. This allows users and teams to work with and scale generative AI, beyond what could be accomplished directly in OpenShift AI. 

Furthermore, watsonx.ai offers integration with watsonx.data and watsonx.governance, supporting a client’s complete enterprise AI/ML lifecycle.

**Are there capabilities – coming from OpenShift AI or RHEL AI - that should be positioned in a watsonx.ai deal?**

Yes.  Key capabilities from Red Hat embedded in watsonx.ai include:

- Through the [InstructLab project, part ](https://huggingface.co/instructlab)of RHEL AI, Red Hat and IBM have released select open source licensed Granite language and code models that are supported and indemnified by both companies. Now, developers can collectively enhance the IBM Granite code models (3B, 8B, 20B, and 34B models), in addition to the previously open sourced Granite 7B English model with new skills and knowledge, just as they would contribute to any other open source project.
- Managing and tuning the deployed High Availability (HA) AI environment with OpenShift AI.  Includes model serving and model monitoring, and hardware acceleration.

**What does the entitlement of RHOAI in [watsonx.ai allow?](http://watsonx.ai/) What are the restrictions or limitations on usage?**

watsonx.ai includes technically unrestricted OpenShift AI. This allows:  

- A single, salable package to meet enterprise customer needs
- Deployable as 
- either a purely open source based RHOAI environment that a developer or low- level focused data scientist would enjoy, 
- or as a full enterprise watsonx.ai with capabilities dependent on RHOAI as a technical pre-requisite
- with no incremental transaction or commercial friction in moving between the two IBM watsonx.ai’s license terms clearly delineate that entitlement to 1 watsonx.ai license  3 VPC is equivalent to 1 RHOAI core (link[ to the terms)  -see](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=L-MNZL-NFMSHF&lc=en) chart 8 below as well

- RHOAI vCPUs are counted as watsonx.ai vCPUs for licensing.
- A total of 180 VPCs of combined RHOAI / watsonx.ai is available to deploy. 
- RHOAI and watsonx.ai do not have to be deployed together, although in this example they are.
