Fusion HCI for watsonx

**~~Key Value Props:~~**

• Up to **90x**

**performance boost**

for queries with

storage acceleration

• Rapid **time to value**,

preconfigured for

performance

**Why, What, and How?**

The Fusion HCI hyperconverged system offers **an appliance-like experience** for **watsonx**. Offering

**dramatic performance gain** over commodity hardware, and the ability to **accelerate queries to**

**remote data sources**, Fusion HCI is the hardware of choice for watsonx

• Ceph is THE **storage**

**of choice for on-**

**prem object store**

data lakes

**~~Case Study:~~**

• IBM CIO office is in

process of replacing

Starburst

• Need to access

globally distribute

data

• **90x performance**

**improvement seen**

**with watsonx.data**

Why watsonx.data on Fusion HCI are better together

Key Differentiators

Reduce TCO by up to 83%

Flexible non-disruptive scaling – start small and grow

. Single racks can support data lakes from 59 TB to 699 TB

. Cluster up to 3 racks to expand capacity

(1)

. Fusion HCI delivers performance and cost efficiency of bare-metal OpenShift

. … combined with the operational simplicity of hyper-convergence

. Efficient 4+2p erasure coding maximizes availability of local NVMe storage

. Eliminate hypervisor cost overhead

. Add remote query acceleration for highest performance

Expand data lake capacity with external Ceph S3

. Cost effective data lakes that can grow to multiple petabytes

Highest performance

(2)

. P03 6-node configurations start at 700K IOPS and 80 GB/s throughput

. P11 14-node configurations max out at 1.6M IOPS and 180 GB/s

. IOPS and throughput scale linearly with addition of storage nodes

. S3 endpoints backed by parallel file system is much faster than SAN storage

. Eliminate hypervisor performance overhead

Accelerate queries to remote object stores

. Accelerate queries to any S3 compliant object store of Azure Blob

. Up to 90x boost in query performance

Query Accelerator – How it works

. Leverages local NVMe storage as cache for remote data

. Transparently mirror remote data residing on multiple S3 or Azure Blob

High reliability and resiliency under load

. Dedicated and redundant 100 GbE storage pod network

. Dedicated and redundant 25 GbE application pod network

. Use policies to configure cache operations – fetch data on demand, pre-

fetch data, set cache size, set expiration/eviction policies

Reduced risk of project failures

. Turnkey appliance-like deployment

. Cached data is available to all compute nodes through S3 endpoints

. S3 endpoints backed by the Fusion high performance scale-out parallel

. Engineered solution reduces risk of improper infrastructure design and missed

file system

performance objectives

. Integrated solution is fully tested and validated with watsonx
