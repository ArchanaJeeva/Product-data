Internal Use Only

In the pilot, the AI governance maturity assessment, and the recommendations to develop the AI governance strategy is work that is done by IBM Consulting.   It is 2 weeks of work done in parallel with the Build phase of the pilot.

All Premier and Elite client watsonx.governance pilots are to include the offer from IBM Consulting to do the Maturity Assessment.  For other clients the assessment is optional and technology team needs to get agreement from IBM Consulting to make the offer of the assessment to the client. 

If you are not offering the AI assessment to the client, either remove the line items with *(IBM Consulting)* slide or use the alternate slide version which has already removed them.

The AI assessment and the strategic recommendations can be very helpful in getting support from more senior executives for the purchase and implementation of .governance as it  will show them how to implement AI governance to address their most critical risk areas.
